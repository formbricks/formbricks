Follow these instructions and guidelines when asked to write documentation in the apps/docs folder

Follow this structure to write the title, describtion and pick a matching icon and insert it at the top of the MDX file:

---

title: "FEATURE NAME"
description: "1 concise sentence to describe WHEN the feature is being used and FOR WHAT BENEFIT."
icon: "link"

---

- Description: 1 concise sentence to describe WHEN the feature is being used and FOR WHAT BENEFIT.
- Make ample use of the Mintlify components you can find here https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt - e.g. if docs describe consecutive steps, always use Mintlify Step component.
- In all Headlines, only capitalize the current feature and nothing else, to Camel Case.
- The page should never start with H1 headline, because it's already part of the template.
- Tonality: Keep it concise and to the point. Avoid Jargon where possible.
- If a feature is part of the Enterprise Edition, use this note:

<Note>
  FEATURE NAME is part of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license) 
</Note>
