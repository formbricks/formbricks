# GitHub Actions Security Best Practices

## Required Security Measures

### 1. Set Minimum GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions

Always explicitly set the minimum required permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  # Only add additional permissions if absolutely necessary:
  # pull-requests: write  # for commenting on PRs
  # issues: write         # for creating/updating issues
  # checks: write         # for publishing check results
```

### 2. Add Harden-Runner as First Step

For **every job** on `ubuntu-latest`, add Harden-Runner as the first step:

```yaml
- name: Harden the runner
  uses: step-security/harden-runner@v2
  with:
    egress-policy: audit # or 'block' for stricter security
```

### 3. Pin Actions to Full Commit SHA

**Always** pin third-party actions to their full commit SHA, not tags:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD - uses mutable tag
- uses: actions/checkout@v4

# ✅ GOOD - pinned to immutable commit SHA
- uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
```

### 4. Secure Variable Handling

Prevent command injection by properly quoting variables:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD - potential command injection
run: echo "Processing ${{ inputs.user_input }}"

# ✅ GOOD - properly quoted
run: echo "Processing ${{ inputs.user_input }}"
env:
  USER_INPUT: ${{ inputs.user_input }}
```

Use `${VARIABLE}` syntax in shell scripts instead of `$VARIABLE`.

### 5. Environment Variables for Secrets

Store sensitive data in environment variables, not inline:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD
run: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}" api.example.com

# ✅ GOOD
env:
  API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
run: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" api.example.com
```

## Workflow Structure Best Practices

### Required Workflow Elements

```yaml
name: "Descriptive Workflow Name"

on:
  # Define specific triggers
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# Always set explicit permissions
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  job-name:
    name: "Descriptive Job Name"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Set job-level permissions if different from workflow level
    permissions:
      contents: read

    steps:
      # Always start with Harden-Runner on ubuntu-latest
      - name: Harden the runner
        uses: step-security/harden-runner@v2
        with:
          egress-policy: audit

      # Pin all actions to commit SHA
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
```

### Input Validation for Actions

For composite actions, always validate inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  user_input:
    description: "User provided input"
    required: true

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Validate input
      shell: bash
      run: |
        # Validate input format/content before use
        if [[ ! "${{ inputs.user_input }}" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$ ]]; then
          echo "❌ Invalid input format"
          exit 1
        fi
```

## Docker Security in Actions

### Pin Docker Images to Digests

```yaml
# ❌ BAD - mutable tag
container: node:18

# ✅ GOOD - pinned to digest
container: node:18@sha256:a1ba21bf0c92931d02a8416f0a54daad66cb36a85d6a37b82dfe1604c4c09cad
```

## Common Patterns

### Secure File Operations

```yaml
- name: Process files securely
  shell: bash
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail  # Fail on errors, undefined vars, pipe failures

    # Use absolute paths and validate
    SAFE_PATH=$(realpath "${{ inputs.file_path }}")
    if [[ "$SAFE_PATH" != "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"/* ]]; then
      echo "❌ Path outside workspace"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Artifact Handling

```yaml
- name: Upload artifacts securely
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@50769540e7f4bd5e21e526ee35c689e35e0d6874 # v4.4.0
  with:
    name: build-artifacts
    path: |
      dist/
      !dist/**/*.log  # Exclude sensitive files
    retention-days: 30
```

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Minimum GITHUB_TOKEN permissions set
- [ ] Harden-Runner added to all ubuntu-latest jobs
- [ ] All third-party actions pinned to commit SHA
- [ ] Input validation implemented for custom actions
- [ ] Variables properly quoted in shell scripts
- [ ] Secrets stored in environment variables
- [ ] Docker images pinned to digests (if used)
- [ ] Error handling with `set -euo pipefail`
- [ ] File paths validated and sanitized
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs or outputs

## Recommended Additional Workflows

Consider adding these security-focused workflows to your repository:

1. **CodeQL Analysis** - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
2. **Dependency Review** - Scan for vulnerable dependencies in PRs
3. **Dependabot Configuration** - Automated dependency updates
