## Open Core Licensing

### The AGPL Formbricks Core

You can use the software for free for personal and commercial use. You're also allowed to create and distribute modified versions as long as you document the changes you make incl. date and **publish your complete code under the AGPLv3 license as well.**

### The Enterprise Edition

Additional to the AGPL licensed Formbricks core, this repository contains code licensed under an Enterprise license. The [code](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/apps/web/modules/ee) and [license](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/web/modules/ee/LICENSE) for the enterprise functionality can be found in the `/apps/web/modules/ee` folder of this repository. This additional functionality is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core and is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an [Enterprise License Key](https://formbricks.com/enterprise-license?source=docs) to unlock it.
