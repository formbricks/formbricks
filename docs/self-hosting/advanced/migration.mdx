### v3.2

<Info>
  With Formbricks 3.0, we introduced an automatic data migration system. If you're using a version older than
  **v2.7**, you must upgrade step-by-step through earlier versions (e.g. **2.4 → 2.5 → 2.6 → 2.7**). Once you
  reach **v2.7**, you can upgrade directly to **any v3.x or future release** without needing intermediate
  migrations.
</Info>

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users who are **self-hosting Formbricks** using the **one-click setup**. If you have a different setup, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.

Before running these steps, **navigate to the `formbricks` directory** where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

1. **Backup your Database**: Backing up your database is crucial before upgrading. Use the following command to create a backup:

```bash
docker exec formbricks-postgres-1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres -d formbricks > formbricks_pre_v3.2_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump
```

<Info>
  If you run into “**No such container**”, use `docker ps` to find your container name,
  e.g. `formbricks_postgres_1`.
</Info>

If you prefer storing the backup as an `*.sql` file remove the `-Fc` (custom format) option. In case of a restore scenario you will need to use `psql` then with an empty `formbricks` database.

1. Pull the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

1. Stop the running Formbricks instance & remove the related containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

1. Restarting the containers with the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

When you start the latest version of **Formbricks**, it will **automatically detect and apply any required data migrations** during startup. You don’t need to run any manual migration steps or download separate migration images.

- Access your updated instance

Once the containers are running, simply go to the **same URL** as before to access your updated **Formbricks** instance.

That’s it! This new process ensures your **Formbricks** setup stays up to date with the latest schema changes as soon as you run the updated container.

## v3.0

<Warning>
  **Important: Do Not Upgrade to 3.0 If You Need SSO, User Identification, or Cluster Support**

With **Formbricks 3.0**, we're making changes to ensure long-term sustainability while still supporting open source. While the **Community Edition** has gained [new features](https://formbricks.com/blog/formbricks-3-0), some [advanced capabilities](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/license) are now part of the **Enterprise Edition**.

⚠️ **No Downgrade Option:** If you upgrade to **3.0** and run the data migration, **you cannot revert to 2.7.2**. If you rely on **SSO, user identification, or cluster support**, either **stay on version 2.7.x** or [reach out](https://formbricks.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1e7671727f5e78716c737c6c777d756d307d7173) **for a custom quote**.

</Warning>

This major release brings a better approach to **data migrations**.

- If you're using **Formbricks v2.7 or later**, you can upgrade **directly** to **v3.x** and future versions.

- If you're on a version **older than v2.7**, you **must upgrade step-by-step** (e.g. **2.4 → 2.5 → 2.6 → 2.7**) before moving to v3.x.

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users **self-hosting** Formbricks with the **one-click setup**. If you're using a different setup, you may need to adjust the commands.

- &#x20;Navigate to the Formbricks Directory

Before running any steps, go to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

- Backup Your Database

Backing up your database is **crucial** before upgrading. Use the following command to create a backup:

```bash
docker exec formbricks-postgres-1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres -d formbricks > formbricks_pre_v3.0_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump

```

<Info>
  **Note:** If you see a “No such container” error, run `docker ps` to find your actual container name (e.g.
  `formbricks_postgres_1`).
</Info>

<Info>
  Tip: If you want to store the backup as a `.sql` file, remove the `-Fc` (custom format) option. If you need
  to restore it later, use `psql` with an empty Formbricks database.
</Info>

- Pull the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

- Stop the running Formbricks instance & remove the related containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Restarting the containers with the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

When you start the latest version of Formbricks, it will automatically detect and run any necessary data migrations during startup. There is no need to run any manual migration steps or pull any separate migration images.

- Access your updated instance

That’s it! Once the containers are up and running, simply navigate to the same URL as before to access your fully migrated Formbricks instance.

## v2.7

<Info>
  AI Features & Database Update: This release lays the groundwork for upcoming AI features, now in private beta. Formbricks requires the `pgvector` extension in PostgreSQL.

One-Click Setup Users: Use the `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image instead of `postgres:15-alpine` to ensure compatibility.

</Info>

Formbricks v2.7 includes all the features and improvements developed by the community during Hacktoberfest 2024. Additionally, this release introduces an advanced team-based access control system, which is available in the Formbricks Enterprise Edition.

### Additional Updates

If you previously used organisation-based access control (an enterprise feature) and the `DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ROLE` environment variable, update its value to one of these roles: `owner`, `manager`, or `member`. Read more about the new roles in the [documentation](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/user-management).

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users who are self-hosting Formbricks using our one-click setup. If you are using a different setup, you might adjust the commands accordingly.

To run all these steps, please navigate to the Formbricks folder where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

- **Backup your Database:** This is a crucial step. Please make sure to backup your database before proceeding with the upgrade. You can use the following command to backup your database.&#x20;

```bash
docker exec formbricks-postgres-1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres -d formbricks > formbricks_pre_v2.7_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump
```

<Note>
  If you run into “No such container”, use `docker ps` to find your container name,
  e.g. `formbricks_postgres_1`.
</Note>

<Note>
  If you want to store the backup as an \*.sql file, remove the `-Fc` option. To restore, use `psql` with an
  empty Formbricks database.
</Note>

- If you use an older `docker-compose.yml` file from the one-click setup, modify it to use the `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image instead of `postgres:15-alpine`:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: pgvector/pgvector:pg15
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```

- Pull the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

- Stop the running Formbricks instance and remove the related containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Restarting the containers with the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Now let's migrate the data to the latest schema:

<Tip>To find the Docker network name for your Postgres database, run `docker network ls`.</Tip>

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:latest && \
docker run --rm \
  --network=formbricks_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/formbricks?schema=public" \
  -e UPGRADE_TO_VERSION="v2.7" \
  ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:v2.7.0

```

The command above will migrate your data to the latest schema. This step is important to update your existing data to the new structure. The changes will only be made if the script runs successfully. You can run the script multiple times safely.

- That's it! Once the migration is finished, you can **access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

## v2.6

Formbricks v2.6 introduces advanced logic jumps for surveys, allowing more complex branching logic, including variables, conditions, and more. This release also includes numerous bug fixes, significant performance improvements for website and app surveys, and enhanced stability.

<Info>
  This release includes the final step of deprecating server-side action tracking (previously used for segment
  filtering by performed actions). The migrations will delete all tracked actions from the database. If you
  still need these action records, ensure you export them before upgrading.
</Info>

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users who are self-hosting Formbricks using our one-click setup. If you're using a different setup, you might need to adjust the commands accordingly.

docker run --rm \
  --network=formbricks_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/formbricks?schema=public" \
  -e UPGRADE_TO_VERSION="v2.1" \
  ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:v2.1.0
```

Once the migration script runs successfully, your data will be migrated to the latest schema. The script is designed to run safely multiple times, so you don’t need to worry if it’s executed more than once. After completing the migration, you can continue to access your Formbricks instance at the same URL as before.

- That's it! Once the migration is complete, you can **now access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

### Changes in Environment Variables

- **SIGNUP_DISABLED** is now deprecated. Self-hosting instances have signup disabled by default, and new users can only be invited by the organization owner or admin.

- **DEFAULT_TEAM_ID** has been renamed to **DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID**.

- **DEFAULT_TEAM_ROLE** has been renamed to **DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ROLE**.

</Info>

If you prefer storing the backup as an `*.sql` file remove the `-Fc` (custom format) option. In case of a restore scenario you will need to use `psql` then with an empty `formbricks` database.

- Pull the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

- Stop the running Formbricks instance & remove the related containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Restarting the containers with the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Now let's migrate the data to the latest schema:

<Info>To find your Docker Network name for your Postgres Database, find it using `docker network ls`</Info>

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:v2.0.3 && \
docker run --rm \
  --network=formbricks_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/formbricks?schema=public" \
  -e UPGRADE_TO_VERSION="v2.0" \
  ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:v2.0.3
```

The above command will migrate your data to the latest schema. This is a crucial step to migrate your existing data to the new structure. Only if the script runs successful, changes are made to the database. The script can safely run multiple times.

- That's it! Once the migration is complete, you can **now access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

### App Surveys with @formbricks/js

With this upgrade, we now dynamically fetch the package from our API endpoint and have updated the package entry points to support both app and website surveys. This ensures that you always have the latest version of the package (v2.0.0+).

**Old approach:** (v1.6.5)

```ts
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js";

formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user-id>", // optional
});
```

**New approach:** (v2.0.0)

Website surveys:

```ts
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js/website";

formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  // userId is not supported here
});
```

App surveys:

```ts
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js/app";

formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user-id>", // required
});
```

## v1.6

Formbricks v1.6 introduces key features like Advanced Targeting, Segmentation, on-the-fly survey triggers, and stability improvements. This update also changes some environment variables. Follow this guide to upgrade your Formbricks instance to v1.6 smoothly.

<Info>
  This upgrade requires a data migration. Ensure you back up your database before proceeding. Follow the steps
  below to upgrade your Formbricks instance to v1.6.
</Info>

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users self-hosting Formbricks with our one-click setup. If you're using a different setup, adjust the commands accordingly.

Navigate to the Formbricks folder containing your `docker-compose.yml` file to run the steps.

- **Backup your Database**: This is a crucial step. Please make sure to backup your database before proceeding with the upgrade. You can use the following command to backup your database:

```bash
docker exec formbricks-quickstart-postgres-1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres -d formbricks > formbricks_pre_v1.6_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump
```

<Info>
  If you run into “No such container”, use `docker ps` to find your container name,
  e.g. `formbricks_postgres_1`.
</Info>

<Info>
  If you prefer storing the backup as a `*.sql` file remove the `-Fc` (custom format) option. In case of a
  restore scenario you will need to use `psql` then with an empty `formbricks` database.
</Info>

- Stop the running Formbricks instance & remove the related containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Restarting the containers will automatically pull the latest version of Formbricks:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Now let's migrate the data to the latest schema:

<Info>To find your Docker Network name for your Postgres Database, find it using `docker network ps`</Info>

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --network=formbricks_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/formbricks?schema=public" \
  -e UPGRADE_TO_VERSION="v1.6" \
  ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:v1.6.1

```

The above command will migrate your data to the latest schema. This is a crucial step to migrate your existing data to the new structure. Only if the script runs successful, changes are made to the database. The script can safely run multiple times.

1. That's it! Once the migration is complete, you can **now access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

#### Restoring the database after a failed upgrade

```bash
docker exec -i formbricks-quickstart-postgres-1 pg_restore --clean -U postgres -v -d formbricks < formbricks_pre_v1.6_<timestamp_of_your_dump_file>.dump
```

<Info>
  Replace the path to `formbricks_pre_v1.6_<timestamp_of_your_dump_file>.dump` with the exact path to your `.dump` file.
</Info>

<Info>This will wipe the database and restore from the `.dump` file.</Info>

### App Surveys with `@formbricks/js`

If you're using the `@formbricks/js` package, update it to version \~1.6.5 to access the latest features and improvements.

<Info>
  Currently, the package needs to be pinned to `~1.6.5`, see [this
  issue](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/issues/2273).
</Info>

### Upgrade and pin the client package

```bash
npm install @formbricks/js@~1.6.5
```

### Helper Shell Script

For a seamless migration, below is a shell script for your self-hosted instance that will automatically update your environment variables to be compliant with the new naming conventions.

### Docker & Single Script Setup

Now that these variables can be defined at runtime, you can append them inside your `x-environment` in the `docker-compose.yml` itself.
For a more detailed guide on these environment variables, please refer to the [Important Runtime Variables](/self-hosting/setup/docker#important-run-time-variables) section.
