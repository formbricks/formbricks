To unlock Formbricks Enterprise Edition features, you need to activate your Enterprise License Key. Follow these steps to activate your license:

## 1. Set the License Key

Add your Enterprise License Key as an environment variable in your deployment:

```bash
ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY=
```

- Add your Enterprise License Key after `ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY=` with the key you received from Formbricks.
- How you set environment variables depends on your deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, .env file, etc.).

## 2. Restart Your Instance

After setting the environment variable, **restart your Formbricks instance** to apply the changes.

## 3. Verify License Activation
To verify if your license is active, visit `Organization Settings` -> `Enterprise License` to check the confirmation screen.

### Troubleshooting
Your server needs to be able to reach the Formbricks License Server. In case you're deploying Formbricks behind a firewall, please reach out to hola@formbricks.com for more info.
