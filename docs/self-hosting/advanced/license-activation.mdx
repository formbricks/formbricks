To unlock Formbricks Enterprise Edition features, you need to activate your Enterprise License Key. Follow these steps to activate your license:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the License Key">
    Add your Enterprise License Key as an environment variable in your deployment:

    ```bash
    ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY=
    ```

    - Add your Enterprise License Key after `ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY=` with the key you received from Formbricks.
    - How you set environment variables depends on your deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, .env file, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Your Instance">
    After setting the environment variable, **restart your Formbricks instance** to apply the changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify License Activation">
    To verify if your license is active, visit `Organization Settings` -> `Enterprise License` to check the confirmation screen.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ensure License Server is Reachable">
    Your Formbricks instance performs a daily license check to verify your Enterprise License. If you're deploying Formbricks behind a firewall or have network restrictions, you need to whitelist the following:

    - **Domain**: `ee.formbricks.com`
    - **URL**: `https://ee.formbricks.com/api/licenses/check`
    - **Protocol**: HTTPS (Port 443)
    - **Method**: POST
    - **Frequency**: Every 24 hours

    The license check includes a 3-day grace period. If the check fails temporarily, your instance will continue using cached license information for up to 3 days.
  </Step>
