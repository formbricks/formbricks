Audit logs record **who** did **what**, **when**, **from where**, and **with what outcome** across your Formbricks instance.


---

## Benefits of audit logging

- **Compliance readiness** — Many regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and SOC 2 require immutable records of user activity.
- **Security investigation support** — Audit logs provide clear visibility into user and system actions, helping teams respond quickly and confidently during security incidents.
- **Operational accountability** — Track changes across the system to answer common questions like "_who modified this?_” or "_when was this deleted?_".

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **`redis`** | Used internally to guarantee integrity under concurrency. |

---

## Enabling audit logging

1. Set the following environment variables in your deployment (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, etc.):

```bash title=".env"
# --- Audit logging ---
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=1
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here        # required for integrity hashes and authentication logs
REDIS_URL=redis://`redis`:6379                 # existing `redis` instance
AUDIT_LOG_GET_USER_IP=1                        # set to 1 to include user IP address in audit logs, 0 to omit (default: 0)
```

2. Redeploy your containers.
3. Confirm you can see audit logs in the output of your containers.

Audit logs are printed to **stdout** as JSON Lines format, making them easily accessible through your container logs or log aggregation systems.

---

## Understanding the log format

Audit logs are **JSON Lines** (one JSON object per line). A typical entry looks like this:

```json
{"level":"audit","time":1749207302158,"pid":20023,"hostname":"Victors-MacBook-Pro.local","name":"formbricks","actor":{"id":"cm90t4t7l0000vrws5hpo5ta5","type":"api"},"action":"created","target":{"id":"cmbkov4dn0000vrg72i7oznqv","type":"webhook"},"timestamp":"2025-06-06T10:55:02.145Z","organizationId":"cm8zovtbm0001vr3efa4n03ms","status":"success","ipAddress":"unknown","apiUrl":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/webhooks","changes":{"id":"cmbkov4dn0000vrg72i7oznqv","name":"********","createdAt":"2025-06-06T10:55:02.123Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-06T10:55:02.123Z","url":"https://eoy8o887lmsqmhz.m.pipedream.net","source":"user","environmentId":"cm8zowv0b0009vr3ec56w2qf3","triggers":["responseCreated","responseUpdated","responseFinished"],"surveyIds":[]},"integrityHash":"eefa760bf03572c32d8caf7d5012d305bcea321d08b1929781b8c7e537f22aed","previousHash":"f6bc014e835be5499f2b3a0475ed6ec8b97903085059ff8482b16ab5bfd34062"}
```

Key fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `level` | Log level, always `"audit"` for audit events |
| `time` | Unix timestamp in milliseconds |
| `pid` | Process ID of the logging instance |
| `hostname` | Hostname of the server generating the log |
| `name` | Application name, typically `"formbricks"` |
| `timestamp` | ISO‑8601 time of the action |
| `actor` | User or API key responsible (object with `id` and `type`) |
| `action` | Constant verb‑noun string (`survey.updated`, `login.failed`, …) |
| `target` | The resource affected (object with `id` and `type`) |
| `status` | `success` or `failure` |
| `organizationId` | Organization identifier where the action occurred |
| `ipAddress` | User IP address, present only if `AUDIT_LOG_GET_USER_IP=1`, otherwise `"unknown"` |
| `apiUrl` | (Optional) API endpoint URL if the logs was generated through an API call |
| `eventId` | (Optional) Available on error logs. You can use it to refer to the system log with this eventId for more details on the error |
| `changes` | (Optional) Only the fields that actually changed (sensitive values redacted) |
| `integrityHash` | SHA‑256 hash chaining the entry to the previous one |
| `previousHash` | SHA‑256 hash of the previous audit log entry for chain integrity |
| `chainStart` | (Optional) Boolean indicating if this is the start of a new audit chain |

---

## Additional details

- **Redacted secrets:** Sensitive fields (e‑mails, access tokens, passwords…) are replaced with `"********"` before being written.
- **Failure events count:** Both successful *and* failed operations are logged.
- **Single source of truth:** The same logs power the `Formbricks` UI and API endpoints.
- **Scope limitation:** For now, **only events triggered inside the `Formbricks` application** are audited. This means:
  - **Embed and Link Surveys** are **not** included in the audit logs.
  - **Survey responses** created via the client API or client-side SDKs are **not** audited.
