<Note>
  This only works with an Ubuntu machine, so ensure the underlying OS is verified beforehand!
</Note>

If you’re looking to quickly set up a production instance of Formbricks on an Ubuntu server, this guide is for you. Using a convenient shell script, you can install everything—including Docker, Postgres DB, and an SSL certificate—in just a few steps. The script takes care of all the dependencies and configuration for your server, making the process smooth and simple.

<Note>
  This setup uses **Traefik** as a **reverse proxy**, essential for directing incoming traffic to the correct container and enabling secure internet access to Formbricks. Traefik is chosen for its simplicity and automatic SSL management via Let’s Encrypt.
</Note>

For other operating systems or a more customized installation, please refer to the advanced installation guide with [Docker](/self-hosting/setup/docker).

### Requirements

* An Ubuntu Virtual Machine with SSH access.

* A custom domain with an **A record** pointing to your server.

* Ports **80** and **443** are open in your VM's Security Group, allowing Traefik to create an SSL certificate.

### Deployment

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/formbricks.sh -o formbricks.sh && chmod +x formbricks.sh && ./formbricks.sh install
```

### Script Prompts

During installation, the script will prompt you to provide some details:

* **Overwriting Docker GPG Keys**:
  If Docker GPG keys already exist, the script will ask whether you want to overwrite them.

🚨 Make sure you have set up the DNS records as well as inbound rules for the domain name and IP address of this instance.

🎉 All done! Please setup your Formbricks instance by visiting your domain at https://my.hosted.url.com. You can check the status of Formbricks & Traefik with 'cd formbricks && sudo docker compose ps.'
```

## Update

To update Formbricks, simply run the following command:

```
./formbricks.sh update
```

The script will automatically pull the latest version of Formbricks from GitHub Container Registry and restart the containers.

## Stop

To stop Formbricks, simply run the following command:

```
./formbricks.sh stop
```

The script will automatically stop all the Formbricks related containers and brings the entire stack down.

## Restart

To restart Formbricks, simply run the following command:

```
./formbricks.sh restart
```

The script will automatically restart all the Formbricks related containers and brings the entire stack up with the previous configuration.

## Uninstall

To uninstall Formbricks, simply run the following command, but keep in mind that this will delete all your data!

```
./formbricks.sh uninstall
```

The script will automatically stop all the Formbricks related containers, remove the Formbricks directory, and delete the Docker network.

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the containers with:

```
./formbricks.sh logs
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

* **Inbound Rules**: Make sure you have added inbound rules for Port 80 and 443 in your VM's Security Group.

* **A Record**: Verify that you have set up an A record for your domain, pointing to your VM's IP address.

* **Check Docker Instances**: Run `docker ps` to check the status of the Docker instances.

* **Check Formbricks Logs**: Run `cd formbricks && docker compose logs` to check the logs of the Formbricks stack.
