## Logging

Formbricks follows Next.js best practices with all logs being written to stdout/stderr, making it easy to collect and forward logs to your preferred logging solution.

### Log Levels

- `debug`: Detailed information for debugging purposes.
- `info`: General information about the system's operation.
- `warn`: Potential issues that may require attention.
- `error`: Errors that occur during the operation of the system.
- `fatal`: Critical errors that cause the system to crash.

### Log Format

Formbricks uses JSON format for logs, which is structured and easy to parse. Each log entry includes:

- `level`: The log level (e.g., info, error).
- `time`: Timestamp of the log entry in milliseconds since epoch.
- `pid`: Process ID of the application.
- `hostname`: Hostname of the server where the log was generated.
- `requestId`: Unique identifier for the request (if applicable).
- `userId`: Unique identifier for the user (if applicable).
- `msg`: The log message.
- `stack`: Stack trace (if applicable).
- `data`: Additional data related to the log entry.

### Example Log Entry

```json
{
  "hostname": "server-1",
  "level": 30,
  "msg": "User logged in successfully",
  "pid": 12345,
  "requestId": "abc-123",
  "time": 1710000000000,
  "userId": "user-789"
}
```

### Configuring Log Levels

You can configure the minimum log level using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Valid values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`.
The default log level in production environments is `warn`, while in development environments it is `debug`.

```env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### AccessDocker Container Logs

```bash
# One-Click setup
cd formbricks
docker compose logs

# Standard Docker commands
docker logs <container-name>
docker logs -f <container-name> # Follow logs
```

### Access Kubernetes Pod Logs

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n <namespace> # Follow logs
```

### Log Forwarding

Since all logs are written to stdout/stderr, you can integrate with various logging solutions:

- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Fluentd/Fluent Bit
- Datadog
- Splunk
- CloudWatch Logs (AWS)

## OpenTelemetry Integration

Formbricks leverages Next.js's built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation for comprehensive observability. When enabled, it automatically instruments various aspects of your application.

Set the following environment variables:

```env
OTEL_ENABLED=true
OTEL_ENDPOINT=<your-collector-endpoint>
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=formbricks
NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE=1 # Optional: enables detailed tracing
```

### Default Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry integration automatically tracks:

- HTTP requests and responses
- Route rendering
- API route execution
- Server-side operations
- Database queries
- External API calls

### Supported Backends

OpenTelemetry data can be exported to various observability platforms:

#### Tracing Backends

- Jaeger
- Zipkin
- Tempo

#### APM & Full-Stack Observability Platforms

- New Relic
- Datadog
- Dynatrace
- Azure Monitor
- AWS X-Ray
- Google Cloud Trace

### Key Metrics

- HTTP request duration
- Database performance
- Memory usage
- Response times
- Error rates

## Prometheus Integration

Formbricks implements a dedicated Prometheus integration using OpenTelemetry's Prometheus exporter. This runs a metrics server on a separate port and exposes metrics in Prometheus format for scraping.

### Configuration

To enable and configure the Prometheus exporter, set the following environment variables:

```env
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=1
PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT=9464  # Optional, defaults to 9464
```

The `PROMETHEUS_ENABLED` environment variable must be set to `1` to enable metrics collection. The `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT` variable is optional and defaults to 9464 if not specified.

The exporter listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and exposes metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint.

### Available Metrics

The metrics exported include:

- **Host Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, network I/O
- **HTTP Metrics**: Request counts, durations, error rates
- **Runtime Metrics**: Garbage collection, event loop timing, heap statistics

### Collecting Metrics

You can scrape metrics from your Prometheus server by adding the following to your Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "formbricks"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["your-formbricks-host:9464"]
```

### Resource Attributes

The metrics include resource attributes automatically detected from:

- Environment variables
- Process information
- Host information

These attributes can help you filter and group metrics in your dashboards.

## Health Checks

Available endpoints:

```
GET /health
```

Use these endpoints for monitoring system health in container orchestration and monitoring tools.
