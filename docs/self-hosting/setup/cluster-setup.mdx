<Note>
  Running Formbricks in a multi-instance cluster configuration is an Enterprise Edition feature and requires an enterprise license key.
</Note>

## Overview

Running Formbricks as a cluster of multiple instances offers several key advantages:

* **High Availability**: Ensure your surveys remain accessible even if some instances fail

* **Load Distribution**: Handle higher traffic by distributing requests across multiple instances

* **Scalability**: Easily scale horizontally by adding more instances as your needs grow

* **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Rolling updates without service interruption

## Requirements

To run Formbricks in a cluster setup, you'll need:

* Enterprise Edition license key

* Shared PostgreSQL database

* Shared Redis cache for session management and caching

* Load balancer to distribute traffic

## Redis Configuration

<Note>
  Redis integration is an Enterprise Edition feature and requires an enterprise license key.
</Note>

Configure Redis by adding the following environment variables to your instances:

```sh env
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
REDIS_HTTP_URL=http://your-redis-host:8000
```

## Coming Soon

We're working on comprehensive Kubernetes deployment instructions to make cluster setup even easier. This will include:

* Kubernetes manifests

* Helm charts

* Detailed scaling configurations

* Production-ready deployment examples

Stay tuned for updates.
