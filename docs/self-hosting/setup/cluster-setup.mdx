<Note>
  Running Formbricks in a multi-instance cluster configuration is an Enterprise Edition feature and requires
  an enterprise license key.
</Note>

## Overview

Running Formbricks as a cluster of multiple instances offers several key advantages:

- **High Availability**: Ensure your surveys remain accessible even if some instances fail

- **Load Distribution**: Handle higher traffic by distributing requests across multiple instances

- **Scalability**: Easily scale horizontally by adding more instances as your needs grow

- **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Rolling updates without service interruption

## Requirements

To run Formbricks in a cluster setup, you'll need:

- Enterprise Edition license key

- Shared PostgreSQL database

- Shared Redis cache for session management and caching

- Load balancer to distribute traffic

## Architecture

The Formbricks cluster setup consists of multiple components working together to provide a scalable and highly available system. Here's a detailed overview of the architecture:

        LB[Load Balancer/Ingress]
    end

    subgraph Formbricks Cluster
        FB1[Formbricks Instance 1]
        FB2[Formbricks Instance 2]
        FB3[Formbricks Instance n]
    end

    subgraph Data Storage
        subgraph PostgreSQL HA
            PSQL_P[(PostgreSQL Primary)]
            PSQL_R[(PostgreSQL Replica)]
        end

        subgraph Redis Cluster
            RC_P[(Redis Primary)]
            RC_R[(Redis Replica)]
        end

        S3[S3 Compatible Storage]
    end

### Component Description

1. **Formbricks Cluster**

   - Multiple Formbricks instances (1..n) running in parallel
   - Each instance is stateless and can handle any incoming request
   - Automatic failover if any instance becomes unavailable

2. **PostgreSQL Database**

   - Primary database storing all survey, response, and contact data
   - Optional high-availability setup with primary-replica configuration
   - Handles all persistent data storage needs

3. **Redis Cluster**

   - Acts as a distributed cache layer
   - Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data
   - Can be configured in HA mode with primary-replica setup
   - Handles session management and real-time features

4. **S3 Compatible Storage**

   - Stores file uploads and attachments
   - Can be any S3-compatible storage service (AWS S3, MinIO, etc.)
   - Provides reliable and scalable file storage

5. **Load Balancer**
   - Distributes incoming traffic across all Formbricks instances
   - Performs health checks and removes unhealthy instances
   - Ensures even load distribution and high availability

## Redis Configuration

<Note>Redis integration is an Enterprise Edition feature and requires an enterprise license key.</Note>

Configure Redis by adding the following environment variables to your instances:

```sh env
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
REDIS_HTTP_URL=http://your-redis-host:8000
```

## S3 Configuration

Configure S3 storage by adding the following environment variables to your instances:

```sh env
# Required for file uploads in serverless environments
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_REGION=your-region
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name

# For S3-compatible storage (e.g., StorJ, MinIO)
# Leave empty for Amazon S3
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-s3-compatible-endpoint

# Enable for S3-compatible storage that requires path style
# 0 for disabled, 1 for enabled
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=0
```

When using S3 in a cluster setup, ensure that:

- All Formbricks instances have access to the same S3 bucket
- The bucket has appropriate CORS settings configured
- IAM roles/users have sufficient permissions for read/write operations

## Kubernetes Setup

Formbricks provides an official Helm chart for deploying the entire cluster stack on Kubernetes. The Helm chart is available in the [Formbricks GitHub repository](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/helm-chart).

### Features of the Helm Chart

The Helm chart provides a complete deployment solution that includes:
- Formbricks application with configurable replicas
- PostgreSQL database (with optional HA configuration)
- Redis cluster for caching
- Optional Traefik ingress controller for routing and SSL termination
- Automatic configuration of dependencies and networking

### Installation Steps

1. Add the Formbricks Helm repository:
```sh
helm repo add formbricks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/helm-chart
helm repo update
```

2. Install the chart:
```sh
helm install formbricks formbricks/formbricks
```

### Configuration Options

The Helm chart can be customized using a `values.yaml` file to configure:
- Number of Formbricks replicas
- Resource limits and requests
- Database configuration
- Redis settings
- Ingress rules and TLS
- Environment variables and secrets

Refer to the [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/helm-chart) for detailed configuration options and examples.
