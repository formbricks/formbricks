description: "Set up Formbricks quickly using our ready-to-use Docker image."
icon: "docker"

The image is pre-built and requires minimal setupâ€”just download it and start the container.

### Requirements

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. These are usually included in tools like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

<Note>
  `docker compose`Â without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the Docker documentation.
</Note>

## Start

* **Create a New Directory for Formbricks**

Open a terminal and run the following commands to create and enter a new directory for Formbricks:

```bash
mkdir formbricks-quickstart && cd formbricks-quickstart
```

* **Download the Docker-Compose File**

Get the docker-compose file from the Formbricks repository by running:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

* **Generate NextAuth Secret**

You need a NextAuth secret for session signing and encryption. Run the command below to generate a random string using `openssl` and automatically insert it into the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
sed -i "/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:$/s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
```

* **Generate Encryption Key**

Next, you need to generate an Encryption Key. This will be used for authenticating and verifying 2 Factor Authentication. TheÂ `sed`Â command below generates a random string usingÂ `openssl`, then replaces theÂ `ENCRYPTION_KEY:`Â placeholder in theÂ `docker-compose.yml`Â file with this generated secret:

```bash
sed -i "/ENCRYPTION_KEY:$/s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
```

* **Generate Cron Secret**

You require a Cron secret to secure API access for running cron jobs. Run the command below to generate a random string using `openssl` and automatically insert it into the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
sed -i "/CRON_SECRET:$/s/CRON_SECRET:.*/CRON_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
```

* **Start the Docker Setup**

Now, youâ€™re ready to run Formbricks with Docker. Use the command below to start Formbricks along with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

```bash
 docker compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background, so they keep running even after you close the terminal.

* **Open Formbricks in Your Browser**

Once the setup is running, open [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access Formbricks. The first time you visit, you'll see a setup wizard. Follow the steps to create your first user and start using Formbricks.

## Update

Please take a look at ourÂ [migration guide](/migration-guide)Â for version specific steps to update Formbricks.

* Pull the latest Formbricks image

```bash
docker compose pull
```

* Stop the Formbricks stack

```bash
docker compose down
```

* Re-start the Formbricks stack with the updated image

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with this command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

In an ideal case, you should see this:
