---

The image is pre-built and requires minimal setup—just download it and start the container.

### Requirements

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. These are usually included in tools like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

<Note>
  `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the
  Docker documentation.
</Note>

## Start

1. **Create a New Directory for Formbricks**

   Open a terminal and run the following commands to create and enter a new directory for Formbricks:

   ```bash
   mkdir formbricks-quickstart && cd formbricks-quickstart
   ```

1. **Download the Docker-Compose File**

   Get the docker-compose file from the Formbricks repository by running:

   ```bash
   curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/stable/docker/docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Generate NextAuth Secret**

   You need a NextAuth secret for session signing and encryption. Run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:$/s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

   For macOS:

   ```bash
   sed -i '' "s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Generate Encryption Key**

   Next, you need to generate an Encryption Key. This will be used for authenticating and verifying 2 Factor Authentication. Run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/ENCRYPTION_KEY:$/s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

   For macOS:

   ```bash
   sed -i '' "s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Generate Cron Secret**

   You require a Cron secret to secure API access for running cron jobs. Run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/CRON_SECRET:$/s/CRON_SECRET:.*/CRON_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

   For macOS:

   ```bash
   sed -i '' "s/CRON_SECRET:.*/CRON_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Start the Docker Setup**

   Now, you're ready to run Formbricks with Docker. Use the command below to start Formbricks along with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background, so they keep running even after you close the terminal.

1. **Open Formbricks in Your Browser**

   Once the setup is running, open [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access Formbricks. The first time you visit, you'll see a setup wizard. Follow the steps to create your first user and start using Formbricks.

## Update

Please take a look at our [migration guide](/self-hosting/advanced/migration) for version specific steps to update Formbricks.

1. Pull the latest Formbricks image

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

1. Stop the Formbricks stack

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

1. Re-start the Formbricks stack with the updated image

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Optional: Adding MinIO for File Storage

MinIO provides S3-compatible object storage for file uploads in Formbricks. If you want to enable features like image uploads, file uploads in surveys, or custom logos, you can add MinIO to your Docker setup.

<Note>
  For detailed information about file storage options and configuration, see our [File Uploads
  Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads) guide.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **For production deployments with HTTPS**, use the [one-click setup script](/self-hosting/setup/one-click)
  which automatically configures MinIO with Traefik, SSL certificates, and a subdomain (required for MinIO in
  production). The setups below are suitable for local development or testing only.
</Warning>

### Quick Start: Using docker-compose.dev.yml (Easiest)

The fastest way to test MinIO with Formbricks is to use the included `docker-compose.dev.yml` which already has MinIO pre-configured.

1. **Start MinIO and Services**

   From the repository root:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

   This starts PostgreSQL, Valkey (Redis), MinIO, and Mailhog.

2. **Access MinIO Console**

   Open http://localhost:9001 in your browser.

   Login credentials:

   - Username: `devminio`
   - Password: `devminio123`

3. **Create Bucket**

   - Click "Buckets" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create Bucket"
   - Name it: `formbricks`

4. **Configure Formbricks**

   Update your `.env` file or environment variables with MinIO configuration:

   ```bash
   # MinIO S3 Storage
   S3_ACCESS_KEY="devminio"
   S3_SECRET_KEY="devminio123"
   S3_REGION="us-east-1"
   S3_BUCKET_NAME="formbricks"
   S3_ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:9000"
   S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE="1"
   ```

5. **Verify in MinIO Console**

   After uploading files in Formbricks, view them at http://localhost:9001:

   - Navigate to Buckets → formbricks → Browse
   - Your uploaded files will appear here

<Note>
  The `docker-compose.dev.yml` file includes MinIO with console access on port 9001, making it easy to
  visually verify file uploads. This is the recommended approach for development and testing.
</Note>

### Manual MinIO Setup (Custom Configuration)

<Note>
  **Recommended**: Use the docker-compose.dev.yml approach above for easier setup. Only use this manual
  approach if you need to customize the MinIO configuration or integrate it into an existing
  docker-compose.yml.
</Note>

If you prefer to manually add MinIO to your own docker-compose.yml:

1. **Add MinIO Service and Init Container**

   Add the following services to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   services:
     # ... existing formbricks and postgres services ...

     minio:
       restart: always
       image: minio/minio@sha256:9966a92a734f9411e32f4f41d7d9d826fcdc0f68c4e20b70295bd4e7c11f8a2f   //(RELEASE.2025-09-07).
       command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
       environment:
         MINIO_ROOT_USER: "formbricks-root"
         MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: "change-this-secure-password"
       ports:
         - "9000:9000"
         - "9001:9001"
       volumes:
         - minio-data:/data

     minio-init:
       image: minio/mc@sha256:37d109dddbbb2c95873f5fc81ac93f37023264770fc580a7564148892087b1b7   //(RELEASE.2025-08-13)
       depends_on:
         - minio
       environment:
         MINIO_ROOT_USER: "formbricks-root"
         MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: "change-this-secure-password"
         MINIO_SERVICE_USER: "formbricks-service"
         MINIO_SERVICE_PASSWORD: "change-this-service-password"
         MINIO_BUCKET_NAME: "formbricks-uploads"
       entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "/tmp/minio-init.sh"]
       volumes:
         - ./minio-init.sh:/tmp/minio-init.sh:ro
   ```

<Note>
  **Recommended**: Keep checking periodically for updates and regenerate hashes using docker inspect --format='{{.RepoDigests}}' minio/minio:latest.
</Note>

2. **Create MinIO Initialization Script**

   Create a file named `minio-init.sh` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   echo '⏳ Waiting for MinIO to be ready...'
   attempts=0
   max_attempts=30
   until mc alias set minio http://minio:9000 "$MINIO_ROOT_USER" "$MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD" >/dev/null 2>&1 \
     && mc ls minio >/dev/null 2>&1; do
     attempts=$((attempts + 1))
     if [ $attempts -ge $max_attempts ]; then
       printf '❌ Failed to connect to MinIO after %s attempts\n' $max_attempts
       exit 1
     fi
     printf '...still waiting attempt %s/%s\n' $attempts $max_attempts
     sleep 2
   done
   echo '🔗 MinIO reachable; alias configured.'

   echo '🪣 Creating bucket (idempotent)...';
   mc mb minio/$MINIO_BUCKET_NAME --ignore-existing;

   echo '📄 Creating JSON policy file...';
   cat > /tmp/formbricks-policy.json << EOF
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": ["s3:DeleteObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::\$MINIO_BUCKET_NAME/*"]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::\$MINIO_BUCKET_NAME"]
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF

   echo '🔒 Creating policy (idempotent)...';
   if ! mc admin policy info minio formbricks-policy >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     mc admin policy create minio formbricks-policy /tmp/formbricks-policy.json || mc admin policy add minio formbricks-policy /tmp/formbricks-policy.json;
     echo 'Policy created successfully.';
   else
     echo 'Policy already exists, skipping creation.';
   fi

   echo '👤 Creating service user (idempotent)...';
   if ! mc admin user info minio "$MINIO_SERVICE_USER" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     mc admin user add minio "$MINIO_SERVICE_USER" "$MINIO_SERVICE_PASSWORD";
     echo 'User created successfully.';
   else
     echo 'User already exists, skipping creation.';
   fi

   echo '🔗 Attaching policy to user (idempotent)...';
   mc admin policy attach minio formbricks-policy --user "$MINIO_SERVICE_USER" || echo 'Policy already attached or attachment failed (non-fatal).';

   echo '✅ MinIO setup complete!';
   exit 0;
   ```

   Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x minio-init.sh
   ```

3. **Update Formbricks Service Dependencies**

   Modify the `formbricks` service to wait for MinIO initialization:

   ```yaml
   formbricks:
     restart: always
     image: ghcr.io/formbricks/formbricks:latest
     depends_on:
       - postgres
       - redis
       - minio-init
     # ... rest of configuration
   ```

4. **Configure S3 Environment Variables**

   Add the following environment variables to the `formbricks` service:

   ```yaml
   # S3 Storage Configuration for MinIO
   S3_ACCESS_KEY: "formbricks-service"
   S3_SECRET_KEY: "change-this-service-password"
   S3_REGION: "us-east-1"
   S3_BUCKET_NAME: "formbricks-uploads"
   S3_ENDPOINT_URL: "http://minio:9000"
   S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: "1"
   ```

5. **Add MinIO Volume**

   Add the MinIO volume to the `volumes` section:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     postgres:
       driver: local
     redis:
       driver: local
     minio-data:
       driver: local
   ```

6. **Start Services**

   Start all services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The `minio-init` container will automatically create the bucket, set up the policy, and create a service user with least-privilege access.

7. **Access MinIO Web Console (Optional)**

   You can access the MinIO web console to visually manage your files:

   Open [**http://localhost:9001**](http://localhost:9001) in your browser.

   Login credentials:
   - Username: `formbricks-root` (or your custom `MINIO_ROOT_USER`)
   - Password: `change-this-secure-password` (or your custom `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`)

   From the console, you can:
   - Browse uploaded files in the `formbricks-uploads` bucket
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Manage access policies
   - View service logs

### Production Setup with Traefik

For production deployments, use the [one-click setup script](/self-hosting/setup/one-click) which automatically configures:

- MinIO service with Traefik reverse proxy
- Dedicated subdomain (e.g., `files.yourdomain.com`) - **required for production**
- Automatic SSL certificate generation via Let's Encrypt
- CORS configuration for your domain
- Rate limiting middleware
- Secure credential generation

The production setup from [formbricks.sh](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/docker/formbricks.sh) includes advanced features not covered in this manual setup. For production use, we strongly recommend using the one-click installer.

### MinIO Setup Summary

Choose the right MinIO setup for your needs:

| Setup Type                 | When to Use            | Complexity      | Features                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **docker-compose.dev.yml** | Development & Testing  | ⭐ Easiest      | Pre-configured, Web Console (port 9001)         |
| **Manual Setup**           | Custom configurations  | ⭐⭐ Moderate   | Full control, Optional Web Console, Custom creds|
| **One-Click Script**       | Production deployments | ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced | HTTPS, Subdomain, Traefik, Auto SSL             |

<Note>
  **For quick testing**: Use docker-compose.dev.yml - it's pre-configured and includes the MinIO web console
  for visual file management.
</Note>

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with this command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

In an ideal case, you should see this:

### MinIO-Specific Troubleshooting

If you added MinIO and encounter file upload issues:

**Check MinIO is running:**

```bash
docker compose ps minio
```

**Check MinIO logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs minio
```

**Verify bucket exists:**

If you enabled the web console (with `--console-address ":9001"` in the command), access it at [**http://localhost:9001**](http://localhost:9001) and verify the bucket exists. Otherwise, use the `mc` client commands below.

**Test connection from Formbricks:**

```bash
docker compose exec formbricks sh -c 'wget -O- http://minio:9000/minio/health/ready'
```

**Common MinIO issues:**

- **Connection refused**: Ensure MinIO container is running and port 9000 is accessible
- **Bucket not found**: Create the bucket using MinIO Console or `mc` client
- **Authentication failed**: Verify `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` match `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`
- **Files not accessible**: Check bucket access policy allows public read if needed
- **Network issues**: Ensure `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` points to `http://minio:9000` (internal Docker network)

<Note>
  **Customizing environment variables**
