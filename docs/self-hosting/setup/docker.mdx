The image is pre-built and requires minimal setup—just download it and start the container.

### Requirements

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. These are usually included in tools like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

<Note>
  `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the Docker documentation.
</Note>

## Start

1. **Create a New Directory for Formbricks**

   Open a terminal and run the following commands to create and enter a new directory for Formbricks:

   ```bash
   mkdir formbricks-quickstart && cd formbricks-quickstart
   ```

1. **Download the Docker-Compose File**

   Get the docker-compose file from the Formbricks repository by running:

   ```bash
   curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Generate NextAuth Secret**

   You need a NextAuth secret for session signing and encryption. Run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:$/s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

   For macOS:

   ```bash
   sed -i '' "s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Generate Encryption Key**

   Next, you need to generate an Encryption Key. This will be used for authenticating and verifying 2 Factor Authentication. Run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/ENCRYPTION_KEY:$/s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

   For macOS:

   ```bash
   sed -i '' "s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Generate Cron Secret**

   You require a Cron secret to secure API access for running cron jobs. Run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/CRON_SECRET:$/s/CRON_SECRET:.*/CRON_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

   For macOS:

   ```bash
   sed -i '' "s/CRON_SECRET:.*/CRON_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. **Start the Docker Setup**

   Now, you're ready to run Formbricks with Docker. Use the command below to start Formbricks along with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background, so they keep running even after you close the terminal.

1. **Open Formbricks in Your Browser**

   Once the setup is running, open [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access Formbricks. The first time you visit, you'll see a setup wizard. Follow the steps to create your first user and start using Formbricks.

## Update

Please take a look at our [migration guide](/self-hosting/advanced/migration) for version specific steps to update Formbricks.

1. Pull the latest Formbricks image

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

1. Stop the Formbricks stack

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

1. Re-start the Formbricks stack with the updated image

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with this command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

In an ideal case, you should see this:
