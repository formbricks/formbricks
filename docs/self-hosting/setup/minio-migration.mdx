title: Migrate local uploads to MinIO (Formbricks 4.0)
description: One‑click migration from local file storage to the new MinIO storage required in 4.0
---

## Why this migration is required

Formbricks 4.0 uses an S3‑compatible object store for all file uploads. For One‑Click installs that previously stored files locally (named volume `uploads` or a host bind like `./uploads`), you must migrate those files to MinIO.

This guide shows a safe, idempotent migration using the script `docker/migrate-to-minio.sh` included in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- DNS: a subdomain for object storage, e.g. `files.<your-domain>` pointing to your server IP
- Your One‑Click installation directory (contains `docker-compose.yml`)
- Docker/Compose installed and working

## What the script does

- Adds MinIO services (`minio`, `minio-init`) and S3 env vars to `docker-compose.yml`
- Asks to restart your Compose stack (you should say Yes)
- Detects your existing upload sources post‑start and migrates them to MinIO
  - Host bind mounts (e.g., `./uploads`)
  - Named volume target in the container (legacy: `/home/nextjs/apps/web/uploads` or custom target)
  - Absolute `UPLOADS_DIR` in the container if set
- Cleans up `docker-compose.yml` after success: removes `UPLOADS_DIR`, removes all `uploads` volume mappings and the root `uploads:` definition
- Optionally restarts again to apply the cleanup

The migration is idempotent: you can re‑run it; existing objects are not duplicated.

## Run the migration

From the directory that contains your `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# Download the latest script
curl -fsSL -o migrate-to-minio.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/stable/docker/migrate-to-minio.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x migrate-to-minio.sh

# Launch the guided migration
./migrate-to-minio.sh
```

The script will:

1. Confirm you have a files subdomain (e.g., `files.example.com`)
2. Ask for the files subdomain to use
3. Inject MinIO + S3 settings into `docker-compose.yml`
4. Ask to restart Docker Compose to start MinIO (answer Yes)
5. Detect upload sources and show a preview
6. Ask to proceed with migration (answer Yes)
7. After success, remove local upload volumes and `UPLOADS_DIR` and ask to restart to apply cleanup

## Verifying the migration

- Check the UI: previously uploaded images/logos/files should load
- List bucket contents with `mc` (reuses minio‑init service env):

```bash
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh minio-init -lc \
'mc alias set minio http://minio:9000 "$MINIO_ROOT_USER" "$MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD" && \
 mc ls -r "minio/$MINIO_BUCKET_NAME" | head -200'
```

- Confirm `docker-compose.yml` no longer contains `UPLOADS_DIR` or `uploads:` volume mappings (post‑cleanup)

## Notes on sources

- The script migrates from multiple sources, in order:
  - Host bind (absolute path resolved by `docker compose config`)
  - Container mount target for named volume `uploads` (e.g., `/home/nextjs/apps/web/uploads` or your custom `.../files/uploads`)
  - Absolute `UPLOADS_DIR` (container path)
- The relative path/key structure is preserved: `${environmentId}/${accessType}/fileName.ext`
- Re‑runs copy only new/changed files (idempotent)

## Troubleshooting

- MinIO 404 on file URLs
  - If you use virtual‑hosted style (`bucket.files.domain`), ensure Traefik router rule includes wildcard:
  ```
  traefik.http.routers.minio-s3.rule=Host(`files.domain`) || HostRegexp(`{any:.+}.files.domain`)
  ```
- InvalidAccessKeyId in UI

  - Happens if keys rotated between runs. Re‑run the script; it reuses S3\_\* credentials and reattaches policy.

- Undefined volume `minio-data`

  - Re‑run; the script ensures `minio-data` exists in the root `volumes:` block.

- List bucket contents
  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh minio-init -lc \
  'mc alias set minio http://minio:9000 "$MINIO_ROOT_USER" "$MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD"; \
   mc ls -r "minio/$MINIO_BUCKET_NAME" | head -200'
  ```

## Rollback

- Your original `docker-compose.yml` is backed up as `docker-compose.yml.backup.<timestamp>`
- To revert, restore the backup and restart Compose:

```bash
cp docker-compose.yml.backup.<timestamp> docker-compose.yml
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

That’s it — you’re on the new MinIO storage for Formbricks 4.0. ✅
