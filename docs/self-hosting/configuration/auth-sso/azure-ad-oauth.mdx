### Microsoft Entra ID

Do you have a Microsoft Entra ID Tenant? Integrate it with your Formbricks instance to allow users to log in using their existing Microsoft credentials. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an Application Registration for your Formbricks instance.

### Requirements

- A Microsoft Entra ID Tenant populated with users. [Create a tenant as per Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant).

- A Formbricks instance running and accessible.

- The callback URI for your Formbricks instance: `{WEBAPP_URL}/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`

## How to connect your Formbricks instance to Microsoft Entra

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Microsoft Entra admin center">
    - Login to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
    - Go to **Applications** > **App registrations** in the left menu.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the application">
    - Name your application something descriptive, such as `Formbricks SSO`.

    ![third](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738250292/image_rooa3w.jpg)

    - If you have multiple tenants/organizations, choose the appropriate **Supported account types** option. Otherwise, leave the default option for _Single Tenant_.

    ![fourth](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738250542/image_nyndzo.jpg)

    - Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web** for the platform and paste your Formbricks callback URI (see Requirements above).

    ![fifth](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738250776/image_s3pgb6.jpg)

    - Click **Register** to create the App registration. You will be redirected to your new app's _Overview_ page after it is created.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collect application credentials">
    - On the _Overview_ page, under **Essentials**:
      - Copy the entry for **Application (client) ID** to populate the `AZUREAD_CLIENT_ID` variable.
      - Copy the entry for **Directory (tenant) ID** to populate the `AZUREAD_TENANT_ID` variable.

    ![sixth](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738250876/image_dj2vi5.jpg)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a client secret">
    - From your App registration's _Overview_ page, go to **Manage** > **Certificates & secrets**.

    ![seventh](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738250913/image_p4zknw.jpg)

    - Make sure you have the **Client secrets** tab active, and click **New client secret**.

    ![eighth](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738250973/image_kyjray.jpg)

    - Enter a **Description**, set an **Expires** period, then click **Add**.

    <Note>
      You will need to create a new client secret using these steps whenever your chosen expiry period ends.
    </Note>

    ![ninth](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738251467/image_bkirq4.jpg)

    - Copy the entry under **Value** to populate the `AZUREAD_CLIENT_SECRET` variable.

    <Note>
      Microsoft will only show this value to you immediately after creation, and you will not be able to access it again. If you lose it, simply create a new secret.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update environment variables">
    - Update these environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` or pass it like your other environment variables to the Formbricks container.

    <Note>
      You must wrap the `AZUREAD_CLIENT_SECRET` value in double quotes (e.g., "THis~iS4faKe.53CreTvALu3"`) to prevent issues with special characters.
    </Note>

    An example `.env` for Microsoft Entra ID in Formbricks would look like this:

    ```yml Formbricks Env for Microsoft Entra ID SSO
    AZUREAD_CLIENT_ID=a25cadbd-f049-4690-ada3-56a163a72f4c
    AZUREAD_TENANT_ID=2746c29a-a3a6-4ea1-8762-37816d4b7885
    AZUREAD_CLIENT_SECRET="THis~iS4faKe.53CreTvALu3"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart and test">
    - Restart your Formbricks instance.
    - You're all set! Users can now sign up & log in using their Microsoft credentials associated with your Entra ID Tenant.
  </Step>
