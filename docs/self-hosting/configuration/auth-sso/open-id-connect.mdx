<Note>OpenID Connect is part of the Formbricks [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license)</Note>

Integrating your own OIDC (OpenID Connect) instance with your Formbricks instance allows users to log in using their OIDC credentials, ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience. Please follow the steps below to set up OIDC for your Formbricks instance.

- Configure your OIDC provider & get the following variables:

- `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`

- `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`

- `OIDC_ISSUER`

- `OIDC_SIGNING_ALGORITHM`

<Note>
  Make sure the Redirect URI for your OIDC Client is set to `{WEBAPP_URL}/api/auth/callback/openid`.
</Note>

- Update these environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` or pass it directly to the running container.

An example configuration for a FusionAuth OpenID Connect in Formbricks would look like:


```yml Formbricks Env for FusionAuth OIDC
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=59cada54-56d4-4aa8-a5e7-5823bbe0e5b7
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=4f4dwP0ZoOAqMW8fM9290A7uIS3E8Xg29xe1umhlB_s
OIDC_ISSUER=http://localhost:9011 
OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME=FusionAuth
OIDC_SIGNING_ALGORITHM=HS256
```


- Set an environment variable `OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME` to the display name of your OIDC provider.

- Restart your Formbricks instance.

- You're all set! Users can now sign up & log in using their OIDC credentials.
