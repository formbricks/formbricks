## Setting Up ActivePieces with Self-Hosted Formbricks

### Prerequisites
- A self-hosted Formbricks instance
- Access to an ActivePieces account

### Configuration Steps

For general setup instructions, refer to our [comprehensive ActivePieces integration guide](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/activepieces).

#### Important Note for Self-Hosting

When following the main guide, pay special attention to **Step 3** where you create a new connection:

Instead of using `app.formbricks.com` as your `APP_URL`, you must substitute this with your own self-hosted Formbricks instance URL.

### Verification

After configuring the connection:
1. Test the integration by submitting a sample survey
2. Verify that your ActivePieces workflow executes as expected
3. Check the logs if you encounter any issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your ActivePieces integration:
- Ensure your self-hosted Formbricks instance is accessible from the internet
- Verify that you've entered the correct URL for your instance
- Check that any necessary API keys are properly configured
