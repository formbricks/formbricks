# Zapier (On Premise)

The Zapier integration allows you to create automations based on survey responses.

<Note>
  If you are using Formbricks Cloud, you will need to configure this
  integration differently. Please follow this guide
  [here](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier) to set it up.
</Note>

## Setup

Setup your Zap: Go to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com/) and create a new Zap. Search for “Formbricks” to get started:

![setup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738253827/image_dj64ty.jpg)

Then, choose the event you want to trigger the Zap on:

![trigger event](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738253929/image_p9kpxj_qxz2hw.jpg)

Connect Formbricks with Zapier: You have to connect Zapier with Formbricks via an API Key:

![connect](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738254011/image_fqjrtl.jpg)

![second](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738254061/image_apgw1y.jpg)

Now you need an API key. Please refer to the [API Key Setup](/developer-docs/rest-api##how-to-generate-an-api-key) page to learn how to create one.

Once you copied it in the newly opened Zapier window, you will be connected:

Voila! You have successfully configured Zapier to work with your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now, you can follow the steps mentioned in the [Zapier Integration](https://formbricks.com/docs/developer-docs/integrations/zapier) section to connect it with your Formbricks app and see it live.
