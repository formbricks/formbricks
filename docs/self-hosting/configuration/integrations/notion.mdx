The Notion integration allows you to automatically send responses to a Notion database of your choice.

<Note>
  If you are using Formbricks Cloud, you will need to configure this
  integration differently. Please follow this guide
  [here](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/notion) to set it up.

## Setup

Enabling the Notion Integration in a self-hosted environment requires a setup using Notion account and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

* Sign up for a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) account, if you don't have one already.

* Go to the [my integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) page and click on **New integration**.

* Fill up the basic information like **Name**, **Logo** and click on **Submit**.

* Now, click on **Distribution** tab on the sidebar. A text will appear which will ask you to make the integration public. Click on that toggle button. A form will appear below the text.

* Now provide it the details such as requested. Under **Redirect URIs** field:

  * If you are running formbricks locally, you can enter `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/integrations/notion/callback`.

  * Or, you can enter `https://<your-public-facing-url>/api/v1/integrations/notion/callback`

* Once you've filled all the necessary details, click on **Submit**.

* Now just copy from the screen the **Client ID** and **Client secret** for your integration & add it to your **Formbricks environment variables** as in the docker compose file:

  * `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth Client ID

  * `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth Client Secret

Voila! You have successfully enabled the Notion integration in your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now you can follow the steps mentioned in [Notion Integration with Formbricks](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/notion) section to link your Notion with Formbricks.
