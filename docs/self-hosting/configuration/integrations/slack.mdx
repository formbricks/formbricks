# Slack (On Premise)

Send survey responses automatically to Slack workspace.

<Note>
  If you are using Formbricks Cloud, you will need to configure this
  integration differently. Please follow this guide
  [here](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack) to set it up.

## Setup

Enabling the Slack Integration in a self-hosted environment requires a setup using slack workspace account and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

<Note>Make sure your self-hosted Formbricks instance works with SSL as Slack requires it.</Note>

* Create a Slack workspace if you don't have one already.

* Go to the [Your apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and **Create New App**.

* Click on **From Scratch** and provide the **App Name** and select your workspace in **Pick a workspace to develop your app in:** dropdown. Click on **Create App**.

* Go to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab on the sidebar and add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:

  * `channels:read`

  * `groups:read`

  * `chat:write`

  * `chat:write.public`

  * `chat:write.customize`

* Add the **Redirect URLs** under **OAuth & Permissions** tab. You can add the following URLs:

  * If you are running formbricks locally, you can enter `https://localhost:3000/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`.

  * Or, you can enter `https://<your-public-facing-url>/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`

* Now, click on **Install to Workspace** and **Allow** the permissions.

* Go to the **Basic Information** tab on the sidebar and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy them & add it to your **Formbricks environment variables** as in the docker compose file:

* `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth Client ID

* `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth Client Secret

* Now, you need to enable the public distribution of your app. Go to the **Basic Information** tab and click on the **Manage distribution** button and click on the "Distribute App".

* Scroll down to the **Share your app with other workspaces** section, complete the checklist and click on the **Activate public distribution** button.

Voila! You have successfully enabled the Slack integration in your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now you can follow the steps mentioned in the [Slack Integration](/developer-docs/integrations/slack) section to link a Slack workspace with Formbricks.
