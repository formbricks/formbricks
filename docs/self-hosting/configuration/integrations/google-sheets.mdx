The Google Sheets integration allows you to automatically send responses to an Google Sheets of your choice.

  [here](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/google-sheets) to set it up.

## Setup

Integrating Google Sheets with a self-hosted Formbricks instance requires configuring Google Cloud and updating your environment variables.

<Note>
  If your Google Cloud Console project has a publishing status of "Testing" your refresh token will expire after 7 days. To avoid that, you need to change the publishing status to "Production". [Google OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=en#expiration)
</Note>

* Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and **create a new project**.

* Enable necessary APIs:

  * Now select the project you just created and go to the **APIs & Services** section.

  * Click on the **Enable APIs and Services** button and search for **Google Sheets API** and enable it.

* Configure OAuth Consent Screen:

  * Go to **OAuth Consent screen** and select the appropriate User Type (External or Internal). Select **Internal** if you want only the users of your Google Workspace to be able to use the integration.

  * Fill the required details:

    * App name: Name displayed during OAuth authentication.

    * User support email and Developer contact information: Your contact details for support.

  * Click on **Save and Continue**.

* Add required Scopes:

* Click on the **Add or Remove Scopes** button and add the scopes:

  * [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email)

  * [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets)

* Click on the **Update** button. Verify the scopes and click on the **Save and Continue** button.

* Skip the **Test Users** section and click on the **Save and Continue** button.

* View the OAuth Consent Screen summary and click on the **Back to Dashboard** button.

* Register OAuth Client:

* Navigate to **Credentials** > **Create Credentials** > **OAuth Client ID**.

* Select **Web Application** and set:

  * Name: Name of the OAuth Client ID.

  * Authorized JavaScript Origins: `https://<your-public-facing-url>`

  * Authorized redirect URIs: `https://<your-public-facing-url>/api/google-sheet/callback`

* Save and note the Client ID and Client Secret.

* Copy the Client ID and Client Secret and set them as environment variables in your Formbricks instance:

  * `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID`

  * `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`

  * `GOOGLE_SHEETS_REDIRECT_URL`

Now just copy **GOOGLE\_SHEETS\_CLIENT\_ID**, **GOOGLE\_SHEETS\_CLIENT\_SECRET** and **GOOGLE\_SHEETS\_REDIRECT\_URL** for your integration & add it to your **Formbricks environment variables** as in the docker compose file:

* `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID`

* `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`

* `GOOGLE_SHEETS_REDIRECT_URL`

Voila! You have successfully enabled the Google Sheets integration in your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now you can follow the steps mentioned in [Google Sheets Integration with Formbricks](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/google-sheets) section to link a Google Sheet with Formbricks.
