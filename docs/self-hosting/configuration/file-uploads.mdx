Formbricks requires S3-compatible storage for file uploads. You can use external cloud storage services or the bundled MinIO option for a self-hosted solution.

## Why Configure File Uploads?

Setting up file storage enables important features in Formbricks, including:

- Adding images to surveys (questions, backgrounds, logos)
- 'File Upload' and 'Picture Selection' question types
- Project logos and branding
- Custom organization logos in emails
- Survey background images from uploads

<Warning>
  If file uploads are not configured, the above features will be disabled and users won't be able to upload
  files or images.
</Warning>

## Storage Options

Formbricks supports S3-compatible storage with two main configurations:

### 1. External S3-Compatible Storage

Use cloud storage services for production deployments:

- **AWS S3** (Amazon Web Services)
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**
- **Wasabi**
- **StorJ**
- Any S3-compatible storage service

### 2. Bundled MinIO Storage (Self-Hosted)

<Warning>
  **Important**: MinIO requires a dedicated subdomain to function properly. You must configure a subdomain
  like `files.yourdomain.com` that points to your server. MinIO will not work without this subdomain setup.
</Warning>

MinIO provides a self-hosted S3-compatible storage solution that runs alongside Formbricks. This option:

- Runs in a Docker container alongside Formbricks
- Provides full S3 API compatibility
- Requires minimal additional configuration

## Configuration Methods

### Option 1: One-Click Setup Script

When using the Formbricks installation script, you'll be prompted to configure file uploads:

```bash
üìÅ Do you want to configure file uploads?
   If you skip this, the following features will be disabled:
   - Adding images to surveys (e.g., in questions or as background)
   - 'File Upload' and 'Picture Selection' question types
   - Project logos
   - Custom organization logo in emails
Configure file uploads now? [Y/n] y
```

#### External S3-Compatible Storage

Choose this option for AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, or other cloud providers:

```bash
üóÑÔ∏è  Do you want to use an external S3-compatible storage (AWS S3/DO Spaces/etc.)? [y/N] y
üîß Enter S3 configuration (leave Endpoint empty for AWS S3):
   S3 Access Key: your_access_key
   S3 Secret Key: your_secret_key
   S3 Region (e.g., us-east-1): us-east-1
   S3 Bucket Name: your-bucket-name
   S3 Endpoint URL (leave empty if you are using AWS S3): https://your-endpoint.com
```

#### Bundled MinIO Storage

Choose this option for a self-hosted S3-compatible storage that runs alongside Formbricks:

<Note>
  **Critical Requirement**: Before proceeding, ensure you have configured a subdomain (e.g.,
  `files.yourdomain.com`) that points to your server's IP address. MinIO will not function without this
  subdomain setup.
</Note>

```bash
üóÑÔ∏è  Do you want to use an external S3-compatible storage (AWS S3/DO Spaces/etc.)? [y/N] n
üîó Enter the files subdomain for object storage (e.g., files.yourdomain.com): files.yourdomain.com
```

The script will automatically:

- Generate secure MinIO credentials
- Create the storage bucket
- Configure SSL certificates for the files subdomain
- Configure Traefik routing for the subdomain

### Option 2: Manual Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` file:

#### For S3-Compatible Storage

```bash
# S3 Storage Configuration
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name

# Optional: For third-party S3-compatible services (leave empty for AWS S3)
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-endpoint.com

# Enable path-style URLs for third-party services (1 for enabled, 0 for disabled)
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

<Note>
  <strong>AWS S3 vs. third‚Äëparty S3:</strong> When using AWS S3 directly, leave `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` unset and
  set `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=0` (or omit). For most third‚Äëparty S3‚Äëcompatible providers (e.g., MinIO,
  DigitalOcean Spaces, Wasabi, Storj), you typically must set `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` to the provider's endpoint and
  set `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1`.
</Note>

## Provider-Specific Examples

### AWS S3

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=AKIA1234567890EXAMPLE
S3_SECRET_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-formbricks-uploads
# S3_ENDPOINT_URL is not needed for AWS S3
# S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=0
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_spaces_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_spaces_secret
S3_REGION=nyc3
S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-formbricks-space
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

### MinIO (Self-Hosted)

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=minio_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=minio_secret_key
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=formbricks-uploads
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://files.yourdomain.com
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

### Compatibility requirement: S3 POST Object support

Formbricks uses the S3 [POST Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPOST.html)
operation (presigned POST) for uploads. Your object storage provider must support this operation. Providers
that do not implement POST Object are not compatible with Formbricks uploads. For example, Backblaze B2's
S3‚Äëcompatible API currently does not support POST Object and therefore will not work with Formbricks file
uploads.

## Bundled MinIO Setup

When using the bundled MinIO option through the setup script, you get:

### Automatic Configuration

- **Storage Service**: MinIO running in a Docker container
- **Credentials**: Auto-generated secure access keys
- **Bucket**: Automatically created `formbricks-uploads` bucket
- **SSL**: Automatic certificate generation for the files subdomain

### Access Information

After setup, you'll see:

```bash
üóÑÔ∏è  MinIO Storage Setup Complete:
   ‚Ä¢ S3 API: https://files.yourdomain.com
   ‚Ä¢ Access Key: formbricks-a1b2c3d4
   ‚Ä¢ Bucket: formbricks-uploads (‚úÖ automatically created)
```

### DNS Requirements

<Warning>
  **Critical for MinIO**: The subdomain configuration is mandatory for MinIO to function. Without proper
  subdomain DNS setup, MinIO will fail to work entirely.
</Warning>

For the bundled MinIO setup, ensure:

1. **Main domain**: `yourdomain.com` points to your server IP
2. **Files subdomain**: `files.yourdomain.com` points to your server IP (this is required for MinIO to work)
3. **Firewall**: Ports 80 and 443 are open in your server's firewall
4. **DNS propagation**: Allow time for DNS changes to propagate globally

## Docker Compose Configuration

For manual setup, update your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  formbricks:
    image: ghcr.io/formbricks/formbricks:latest
    environment:
      # ... other environment variables ...

      # S3 Storage Configuration
      S3_ACCESS_KEY: your_access_key
      S3_SECRET_KEY: your_secret_key
      S3_REGION: us-east-1
      S3_BUCKET_NAME: your-bucket-name
      S3_ENDPOINT_URL: https://your-endpoint.com # Optional
      S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: 1 # For third-party services
    volumes:
      - uploads:/home/nextjs/apps/web/uploads/ # Still needed for temporary files
```

## Security Considerations

### S3 Bucket Permissions

Configure your S3 bucket with a least-privileged policy:

1. **Scoped Public Read Access**: Only allow public read access to specific prefixes where needed
2. **Restricted Write Access**: Only your Formbricks instance should be able to upload files
3. **CORS Configuration**: Allow requests from your Formbricks domain

Example least-privileged S3 bucket policy:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/uploads/public/*",
      "Sid": "PublicReadForPublicUploads"
    },
    {
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/formbricks-service"
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
      "Sid": "AllowFormbricksWrite"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

### MinIO Security

When using bundled MinIO:

- Credentials are auto-generated and secure
- Access is restricted through Traefik proxy
- CORS is automatically configured
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse
- A bucket policy with the least privileges is applied to the bucket

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Files not uploading:**

1. Check that S3 credentials are correct
2. Verify bucket exists and is accessible
3. Ensure bucket permissions allow uploads from your server
4. Check network connectivity to S3 endpoint

**Images not displaying in surveys:**

1. Verify bucket has public read access
2. Check CORS configuration allows requests from your domain
3. Ensure S3_ENDPOINT_URL is correctly set for third-party services

**MinIO not starting:**

1. **Verify subdomain DNS**: Ensure `files.yourdomain.com` points to your server IP (this is the most common issue)
2. **Check DNS propagation**: Use tools like `nslookup` or `dig` to verify DNS resolution
3. **Verify ports**: Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open in your firewall
4. **SSL certificate**: Check that SSL certificate generation completed successfully
5. **Container logs**: Check Docker container logs: `docker compose logs minio`

### Testing Your Configuration

To test if file uploads are working:

1. **Admin Panel**: Try uploading a project logo in the project settings
2. **Survey Editor**: Attempt to add a background image to a survey
3. **Question Types**: Create a 'File Upload' or 'Picture Selection' question
4. **Check Logs**: Monitor container logs for any storage-related errors

```bash
# Check Formbricks logs
docker compose logs formbricks

# Check MinIO logs (if using bundled MinIO)
docker compose logs minio
```
