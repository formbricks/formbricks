Formbricks requires S3-compatible storage for file uploads. You can use external cloud storage services or the bundled MinIO option for a self-hosted solution.

## Why Configure File Uploads?

Setting up file storage enables important features in Formbricks, including:

- Adding images to surveys (questions, backgrounds, logos)
- 'File Upload' and 'Picture Selection' question types
- Project logos and branding
- Custom organization logos in emails
- Survey background images from uploads

<Warning>
  If file uploads are not configured, the above features will be disabled and users won't be able to upload
  files or images.
</Warning>

## Storage Options

Formbricks supports S3-compatible storage with two main configurations:

### 1. External S3-Compatible Storage

Use cloud storage services for production deployments:

- **AWS S3** (Amazon Web Services)
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**
- **Backblaze B2**
- **Wasabi**
- **StorJ**
- Any S3-compatible storage service

### 2. Bundled MinIO Storage (Self-Hosted)

<Warning>
  **Important**: MinIO requires a dedicated subdomain to function properly. You must configure a subdomain
  like `files.yourdomain.com` that points to your server. MinIO will not work without this subdomain setup.
</Warning>

MinIO provides a self-hosted S3-compatible storage solution that runs alongside Formbricks. This option:

- Runs in a Docker container alongside Formbricks
- Provides full S3 API compatibility
- Requires minimal additional configuration

## Configuration Methods

### Option 1: One-Click Setup Script

When using the Formbricks installation script, you'll be prompted to configure file uploads:

```bash
📁 Do you want to configure file uploads?
   If you skip this, the following features will be disabled:
   - Adding images to surveys (e.g., in questions or as background)
   - 'File Upload' and 'Picture Selection' question types
   - Project logos
   - Custom organization logo in emails
Configure file uploads now? [Y/n] y
```

#### External S3-Compatible Storage

Choose this option for AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, or other cloud providers:

```bash
🗄️  Do you want to use an external S3-compatible storage (AWS S3/DO Spaces/etc.)? [y/N] y
🔧 Enter S3 configuration (leave Endpoint empty for AWS S3):
   S3 Access Key: your_access_key
   S3 Secret Key: your_secret_key
   S3 Region (e.g., us-east-1): us-east-1
   S3 Bucket Name: your-bucket-name
   S3 Endpoint URL (leave empty if you are using AWS S3): https://your-endpoint.com
```

#### Bundled MinIO Storage

Choose this option for a self-hosted S3-compatible storage that runs alongside Formbricks:

<Note>
  **Critical Requirement**: Before proceeding, ensure you have configured a subdomain (e.g.,
  `files.yourdomain.com`) that points to your server's IP address. MinIO will not function without this
  subdomain setup.
</Note>

```bash
🗄️  Do you want to use an external S3-compatible storage (AWS S3/DO Spaces/etc.)? [y/N] n
🔗 Enter the files subdomain for object storage (e.g., files.yourdomain.com): files.yourdomain.com
```

The script will automatically:

- Generate secure MinIO credentials
- Create the storage bucket
- Configure SSL certificates for the files subdomain
- Configure Traefik routing for the subdomain

### Option 2: Manual Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` file:

#### For S3-Compatible Storage

```bash
# S3 Storage Configuration
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name

# Optional: For third-party S3-compatible services (leave empty for AWS S3)
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-endpoint.com

# Enable path-style URLs for third-party services (1 for enabled, 0 for disabled)
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

## Provider-Specific Examples

### AWS S3

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=AKIA1234567890EXAMPLE
S3_SECRET_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-formbricks-uploads
# S3_ENDPOINT_URL is not needed for AWS S3
# S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=0
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_spaces_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_spaces_secret
S3_REGION=nyc3
S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-formbricks-space
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

### MinIO (Self-Hosted)

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=minio_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=minio_secret_key
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=formbricks-uploads
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://files.yourdomain.com
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

### Backblaze B2

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_b2_key_id
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_b2_application_key
S3_REGION=us-west-000
S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-formbricks-bucket
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1
```

## Bundled MinIO Setup

When using the bundled MinIO option through the setup script, you get:

### Automatic Configuration

- **Storage Service**: MinIO running in a Docker container
- **Credentials**: Auto-generated secure access keys
- **Bucket**: Automatically created `formbricks-uploads` bucket
- **SSL**: Automatic certificate generation for the files subdomain

### Access Information

After setup, you'll see:

```bash
🗄️  MinIO Storage Setup Complete:
   • S3 API: https://files.yourdomain.com
   • Access Key: formbricks-a1b2c3d4
   • Bucket: formbricks-uploads (✅ automatically created)
```

### DNS Requirements

<Warning>
  **Critical for MinIO**: The subdomain configuration is mandatory for MinIO to function. Without proper
  subdomain DNS setup, MinIO will fail to work entirely.
</Warning>

For the bundled MinIO setup, ensure:

1. **Main domain**: `yourdomain.com` points to your server IP
2. **Files subdomain**: `files.yourdomain.com` points to your server IP (this is required for MinIO to work)
3. **Firewall**: Ports 80 and 443 are open in your server's firewall
4. **DNS propagation**: Allow time for DNS changes to propagate globally

## Docker Compose Configuration

For manual setup, update your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  formbricks:
    image: ghcr.io/formbricks/formbricks:latest
    environment:
      # ... other environment variables ...

      # S3 Storage Configuration
      S3_ACCESS_KEY: your_access_key
      S3_SECRET_KEY: your_secret_key
      S3_REGION: us-east-1
      S3_BUCKET_NAME: your-bucket-name
      S3_ENDPOINT_URL: https://your-endpoint.com # Optional
      S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: 1 # For third-party services
    volumes:
      - uploads:/home/nextjs/apps/web/uploads/ # Still needed for temporary files
```

## Security Considerations

### S3 Bucket Permissions

Configure your S3 bucket with a least-privileged policy:

1. **Scoped Public Read Access**: Only allow public read access to specific prefixes where needed
2. **Restricted Write Access**: Only your Formbricks instance should be able to upload files
3. **CORS Configuration**: Allow requests from your Formbricks domain

Example least-privileged S3 bucket policy:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/uploads/public/*",
      "Sid": "PublicReadForPublicUploads"
    },
    {
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/formbricks-service"
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
      "Sid": "AllowFormbricksWrite"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

### MinIO Security

When using bundled MinIO:

- Credentials are auto-generated and secure
- Access is restricted through Traefik proxy
- CORS is automatically configured
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse
- A bucket policy with the least privileges is applied to the bucket

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Files not uploading:**

1. Check that S3 credentials are correct
2. Verify bucket exists and is accessible
3. Ensure bucket permissions allow uploads from your server
4. Check network connectivity to S3 endpoint

**Images not displaying in surveys:**

1. Verify bucket has public read access
2. Check CORS configuration allows requests from your domain
3. Ensure S3_ENDPOINT_URL is correctly set for third-party services

**MinIO not starting:**

1. **Verify subdomain DNS**: Ensure `files.yourdomain.com` points to your server IP (this is the most common issue)
2. **Check DNS propagation**: Use tools like `nslookup` or `dig` to verify DNS resolution
3. **Verify ports**: Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open in your firewall
4. **SSL certificate**: Check that SSL certificate generation completed successfully
5. **Container logs**: Check Docker container logs: `docker compose logs minio`

### Testing Your Configuration

To test if file uploads are working:

1. **Admin Panel**: Try uploading a project logo in the project settings
2. **Survey Editor**: Attempt to add a background image to a survey
3. **Question Types**: Create a 'File Upload' or 'Picture Selection' question
4. **Check Logs**: Monitor container logs for any storage-related errors

```bash
# Check Formbricks logs
docker compose logs formbricks

# Check MinIO logs (if using bundled MinIO)
docker compose logs minio
```
