<Note>
  Formbricks One-Click setup already comes with a valid SSL certificate using **Let's Encrypt**. This guide is only if you already have a valid SSL certificate that you need to use due to company policy or other requirements.
</Note>

Formbricks' One-Click setup automatically creates an SSL certificate using **Let's Encrypt**. However, some setups need a custom SSL certificate. This is common for intranets or systems with special certificate rules that use an internal or custom certificate authority (CA).

### Step 1: Navigate to the Formbricks Folder

Move into the `formbricks/` directory:

```bash
cd formbricks
```

### Step 2: Create a Folder for SSL Certificates

Create a folder called `certs` and place your SSL certificate files inside:

```bash
mkdir certs
# Move your SSL certificate files to the certs folder
mv /path/to/your/fullchain.crt certs/
mv /path/to/your/cert.key certs/
```

### Step 3: Understand SSL Certificate Files

* **fullchain.crt** â€“ Your SSL certificate, including the full certificate chain.

* **cert.key** â€“ The private key used to encrypt data.

### Step 4: Set Correct File Permissions

Ensure the certificate files have the right permissions:

```bash
sudo chown root:root certs/*
sudo chmod 600 certs/*
```

### Step 5: Update `traefik.yaml`

Modify the file to define HTTP and HTTPS settings:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml traefik.yaml
  entryPoints:
    web:
      address: ":80"
      http:
        redirections:
          entryPoint:
            to: websecure
            scheme: https
            permanent: true
    websecure:
      address: ":443"

  providers:
    docker:
      watch: true
      exposedByDefault: false
    file:
      directory: /etc/traefik/dynamic
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 6: Create `certs-traefik.yaml`

Create aÂ `certs-traefik.yaml`Â file that specifies the path to your custom SSL certificate and key.

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml certs-traefik.yaml
  tls:
    certificates:
      - certFile: /certs/fullchain.crt
        keyFile: /certs/cert.key
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 7: Update `docker-compose.yml`

Modify the configuration to enforce SSL. The rest of the configuration should remain the same as the One-Click setup:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml docker-compose.yml
  services:
    formbricks:
      restart: always
      image: ghcr.io/formbricks/formbricks:latest
      depends_on:
        - postgres
      labels:
        - "traefik.enable=true"  # Enable Traefik for this service
        - "traefik.http.routers.formbricks.rule=Host(`my-domain.com`)"  # Use your actual domain or IP
        - "traefik.http.routers.formbricks.entrypoints=websecure"  # Use the websecure entrypoint (port 443 with TLS)
        - "traefik.http.routers.formbricks.tls=true"  # Enable TLS
        - "traefik.http.services.formbricks.loadbalancer.server.port=3000"  # Forward traffic to Formbricks on port 3000
      ports:
        - 3000:3000
      volumes:
        - uploads:/home/nextjs/apps/web/uploads/
      <<: *environment

    traefik:
      image: "traefik:v2.7"
      restart: always
      container_name: "traefik"
      depends_on:
        - formbricks
      ports:
        - "80:80"
        - "443:443"
        - "8080:8080"
      volumes:
        - ./traefik.yaml:/traefik.yaml
        - ./acme.json:/acme.json
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
        - ./certs:/certs
        - ./certs-traefik.yaml:/etc/traefik/dynamic/certs-traefik.yaml
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Summary

* **Navigate to the Formbricks folder**

* **Create a `certs/` folder** and move your certificate files inside.

* **Ensure you have the correct certificate files** (`fullchain.crt` and `cert.key`).

* **Update file permissions** for security.

* **Modify `traefik.yaml`** to handle HTTPS.

* **Create `certs-traefik.yaml`** to point to your certificate files.

* **Update `docker-compose.yml`** to use your custom SSL certificate.

This setup ensures that Formbricks securely communicates using your own SSL certificate. ðŸš€
