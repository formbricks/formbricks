Formbricks supports both single domain and second domain configurations. This guide will help you set up your domains correctly.

## Single Domain Setup

For a single domain setup, you need to configure two essential environment variables:

1. `WEBAPP_URL`: The base URL of your Formbricks instance
2. `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The authentication URL (should be the same as WEBAPP_URL)

### Example Configuration

```bash
WEBAPP_URL=https://formbricks.example.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://formbricks.example.com
```

### Important Notes

- Both URLs must be the same for authentication to work properly
- The URLs should be the full URL including the protocol (http:// or https://)
- Make sure your domain is properly configured in your DNS settings
- If you're using HTTPS (recommended), ensure you have valid SSL certificates installed

## Second Domain Setup (Survey Domain)

Formbricks allows you to serve surveys from a different domain than your main application. This is useful for:

- Separating your admin interface from public surveys
- Using a dedicated domain for surveys

### Configuration

To set up a second domain for surveys:

1. Set up DNS records for your survey domain (e.g., `surveys.example.com`)
2. Configure your web server or reverse proxy to route requests from the survey domain to the Formbricks application
3. Set the `SURVEY_URL` environment variable to your survey domain

### Example Configuration

```bash
WEBAPP_URL=https://formbricks.example.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://formbricks.example.com
SURVEY_URL=https://surveys.example.com
```

### Important Notes

- The `SURVEY_URL` must be a valid URL with protocol
- When `SURVEY_URL` is set, all public survey links will use this domain.
- If `SURVEY_URL` is not set, surveys will be served from the `WEBAPP_URL` domain
- Make sure your DNS and SSL certificates are properly configured for both domains
- The survey domain should be properly configured in your reverse proxy or web server
- **Important**: The second domain is exclusively for serving surveys. Any non-survey paths accessed on this domain will return a 404 error. This is a security feature to ensure the survey domain only serves survey content.
