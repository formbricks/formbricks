Formbricks offers two types of APIs: the **Public Client API** and the **Management API**. Each API serves a different purpose, has *different* authentication requirements, and provides access to different data and settings.

### API Key Setup

Checkout the [API Key Setup](/api-reference/rest-api) to access the Management APIs with an API Key.

If you’ve forked the collection and are running it, update the `apiKey` and `environmentId` in the collection variables with your values. We also provide post-run scripts to help auto-assign variables when running scripts.
