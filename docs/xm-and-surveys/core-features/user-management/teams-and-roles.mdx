Team-level roles provide more granular permissions within specific teams and projects. These roles work alongside organization-level roles to create a flexible permission system.

<Note>
  Team-level roles are a feature of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license). In the Community Edition, all members are Organisation-level "Owners".

## Understanding the role hierarchy

Formbricks uses a two-tier permission system:

1. **Organization-level roles** - Apply across all teams and projects
2. **Team-level roles** - Apply within specific teams and projects

### How roles interact

- Organization-level roles (Owner, Manager) can override team-level restrictions
- Team-level roles provide granular control for specific teams
- Project permissions further refine what users can do within individual projects

## Team-level roles

### Team Admins
- Have additional permissions to manage their team's membership and projects
- Can add or remove team members
- Can create and manage projects within their team
- Can assign project-level permissions to team members
- These permissions are granted at the team-level and don't apply to teams where they're not a Team Admin

### Team Contributors
- Can view and act on surveys and responses within their assigned projects
- Cannot manage team membership or create new projects
- Permissions depend on their project-level access (Read, Read & Write, or Manage)

## Project-level permissions

Within each project, team members can have one of three permission levels:

### Read
- Read access to all resources (except settings) in the project
- Can view surveys, responses, and analytics
- Cannot create, edit, or delete surveys
- Cannot modify project settings

### Read & Write
- Read & write access to all resources (except settings) in the project
- Can create, edit, and delete surveys
- Can manage responses and tags
- Can download survey data
- Cannot modify project settings or manage integrations

### Manage
- Read & write access to all resources including settings in the project
- Full project control including settings
- Can manage API keys and integrations
- Can configure project-level settings like recontact options and styling
- Can manage project tags and actions
