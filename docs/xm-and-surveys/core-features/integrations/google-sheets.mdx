  Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at least one question and a Google Sheet in the Google account you integrated.

## What info do you need?

* Your **Email ID** for authentication (We use this to identify you)

* Your **Google Sheets Names and IDs** (We fetch this to list and show you the options of choosing a sheet to integrate with)

* Write access to **selected Google Sheet** (The google sheet you choose to integrate it with, we write survey responses to it)

For the above, we ask for:

1. **User Email**: To identify you (that's it, nothing else, we're opensource, see this in our codebase [here](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/web/app/api/google-sheet/callback/route.ts#L47C17-L47C25))

2. **Google Spreadsheet API**: To write to the spreadsheet you select (that's it, nothing else, we're opensource, see this method in our codebase [here](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/lib/googleSheet/service.ts#L70))
