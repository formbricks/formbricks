The slack integration allows you to automatically send responses to a Slack channel of your choice.

<Note>
  If you are on a self-hosted instance, you will need to configure this
  integration separately. Please follow the guides
  [here](/self-hosting/configuration/integrations) to configure integrations on your
  self-hosted instance.
</Note>

## Formbricks Cloud

1. Go to the Integrations tab in your [Formbricks Cloud dashboard](https://app.formbricks.com/) and click on the "Connect" button under Slack integration.

<Note>
  Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at
  least one question and a Slack channel in the Slack workspace you integrated.
</Note>

5. In order to make your channel available in channel dropdown, you need to add formbricks integration bot to the channel you want to link. You can do this by going to channel settings -> Integrations -> Add apps -> Search for "Formbricks" -> Select the bot -> Add.

Congratulations! You have successfully linked a Slack channel with Formbricks. Now whenever a response is submitted for the linked survey, it will be automatically sent to the linked Slack channel.

## Setup in self-hosted Formbricks

Enabling the Slack Integration in a self-hosted environment requires a setup using slack workspace account and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

<Note>
  If you are running Formbricks locally:
  
  You need to use `https` instead of `http` for the redirect URI. 
  - You can update the `go` script in your `apps/web/package.json` to include the `--experimental-https` flag. The
  command will look like: <br />
    ```bash
      "go": next dev --experimental-https -p 3000
    ```

- You also need to update the .env file in the `apps/web` directory to include the `WEBAPP_URL` as `https://localhost:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3000`.

- You also need to run the terminal in admin mode to run the `go` script(to acquire the SSL certificate). You can do this by running the terminal as an administrator or using the `sudo` command in Unix-based systems.

</Note>

1. Create a Slack workspace if you don't have one already.
2. Go to the [Your apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and **Create New App**.
3. Click on **From Scratch** and provide the **App Name** and select your workspace in **Pick a workspace to develop your app in:** dropdown. Click on **Create App**.
4. Go to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab on the sidebar and add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:

   - `channels:read`
   - `groups:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.public`
   - `chat:write.customize`

5. Add the **Redirect URLs** under **OAuth & Permissions** tab. You can add the following URLs:

   - If you are running formbricks locally, you can enter `https://localhost:3000/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`.
   - Or, you can enter `https://<your-public-facing-url>/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`

6. Now, click on **Install to Workspace** and **Allow** the permissions.
7. Go to the **Basic Information** tab on the sidebar and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy them and set them as the environment variables in your Formbricks instance as:

- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth Client ID
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth Client Secret

8. Now, you need to enable the public distribution of your app. Go to the **Basic Information** tab and click on the **Manage distribution** button and click on the "Distribute App".
9. Scroll down to the **Share your app with other workspaces** section, complete the checklist and click on the **Activate public distribution** button.

### By now, your environment variables should include the below ones:

- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`

Voila! You have successfully enabled the Slack integration in your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now you can follow the steps mentioned in the [Formbricks Cloud](#formbricks-cloud) section to link a Slack workspace with Formbricks.
