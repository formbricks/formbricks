### **Webhook Triggers**

Webhooks are configured to send notifications based on trigger events. The available triggers include:

* **`responseCreated`**

* **`responseUpdated`**

* **`responseFinished`**

***

### **Creating Webhooks**

You can create webhooks either through the **Formbricks App UI** or programmatically via the **Webhook API**.

#### **Creating Webhooks via UI**

* **Log in to Formbricks**
  Navigate to the **Integrations** Tab after logging in.
