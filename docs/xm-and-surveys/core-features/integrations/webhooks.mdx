description: "With webhooks, you can receive real-time HTTP notifications when specific objects change in your Formbricks environment. This allows you to stay updated and trigger automated actions based on these events."

### **Webhook Triggers**

Webhooks are configured to send notifications based on trigger events. The available triggers include:

- **`responseCreated`**

- **`responseUpdated`**

- **`responseFinished`**

---

### **Creating Webhooks**

You can create webhooks either through the **Formbricks App UI** or programmatically via the **Webhook API**.

#### **Creating Webhooks via UI**

- **Log in to Formbricks**
  Navigate to the **Integrations** Tab after logging in.

- Add your webhook listener endpoint & test it to make sure it can receive the test endpoint otherwise you will not be able to save it.

- Now add the triggers you want to listen to and the surveys!

- That’s it! Your webhooks will not start receiving data as soon as it arrives!

![Step five](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738094816/image_xvrel1.jpg)**API**: Use our documented methods on the **Creation**, **List**, and **Deletion** endpoints of the Webhook API mentioned in our [API v2 playground](https://formbricks.com/docs/api-v2-reference/management-api-%3E-webhooks/get-webhooks).
