description: "With webhooks, you can receive real-time HTTP notifications when specific objects change in your Formbricks environment. This allows you to stay updated and trigger automated actions based on these events."

### **Webhook Triggers**

Webhooks are configured to send notifications based on trigger events. The available triggers include:

- **`responseCreated`**

- **`responseUpdated`**

- **`responseFinished`**

---

## **Creating Webhooks**

You can create webhooks either through the **Formbricks App UI** or programmatically via the **Webhook API**.

## **Creating Webhooks via UI**

- **Log in to Formbricks**
  and click on the `Configuration` tab in the left sidebar and then click on the `Integrations` tab.

![Step one](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/webhooks/integrations-tab.webp)

- Click onÂ **Manage Webhooks**Â & thenÂ **Add Webhook**Â button:

![Step two](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738094259/j4a92z2q43twgamogpny.webp)

- Add your webhook listener endpoint & test it to make sure it can receive the test endpoint otherwise you will not be able to save it.

![Step three](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738094617/image_kubsnz.jpg)

- Now add the triggers you want to listen to and the surveys!

- Thatâ€™s it! Your webhooks will not start receiving data as soon as it arrives!

![Step five](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738094816/image_xvrel1.jpg)

## **Creating Webhooks via API**

Use our documented methods on the **Creation**, **List**, and **Deletion** endpoints of the Webhook API mentioned in our [API v2 playground](https://formbricks.com/docs/api-v2-reference/management-api-%3E-webhooks/get-webhooks).

If you encounter any issues or need help setting up webhooks, feel free to reach out to us on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/discussions). ðŸ˜ƒ
