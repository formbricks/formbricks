The Airtable integration allows you to automatically send responses to an Airtable of your choice.

<Note>
  If you are on a self-hosted instance, you will need to configure this integration separately. Please follow the guides [here](/self-hosting/configuration/integrations) to configure integrations on your self-hosted instance.

<Note>
  Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at least one question and a Airtable base with atleast one table in the Airtable account you integrated.

1. Now click on the "Link New Table" button to link an Airtable with Formbricks and a modal will open up.
