To run a targeted survey on your WordPress website, Formbricks is the way to go!&#x20;

With our generous free plan and open source tech, you get everything you need to get started and keep full control over your data.

## TLDR

1. Install the Formbricks WordPress plugin

2. Create a [free Formbricks account](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

3. Find and copy the `environment id`

4. Copy the environment id into the right field in the plugin settings

5. Create survey on trigger “New Session” to test it

## Step 1: Install the Formbricks WordPress plugin

As long as the Formbricks plugin is in review, please download it from our [GitHub repository directly.](https://github.com/formbricks/wordpress)

## Step 3: Find and copy the environmentId

Go to Settings > Setup Checklist where you’ll find your environmentId:

## Step 4: Copy the environmentId to the WordPress Plugin Settings

In your WordPress instance, go to the Formbricks Plugin settings and copy the environmentId in the correct field:

![Free and open source HotJar survey on WordPress page](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/wordpress/step-4-copy-to-wordpress-for-free-targeted-survey.webp)

Then click the button at the bottom to see if the connection worked.

<Note>If you don’t use our Cloud, you also have to update the API Host</Note>

Great!

## Step 5: Create survey on trigger “New Session”

Now that all is setup, we create a survey to display an example survey. Create a survey and open survey editor.

Keep the content for now, click on the Settings tab:

![Free and open source HotJar survey on WordPress page](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/wordpress/4-wordpress-website-survey-target-visitor-free.webp)

Here we do three things:

1. Change survey type to **App Survey** or **Website Survey**(for public facing)

2. Select trigger “New Session”

3. Publish
