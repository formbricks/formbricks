# Connect Formbricks with your WordPress page

If you want to run a targeted survey on your WordPress website, Formbricks is the way to go! With our generous free plan and open source tech, you get everything you need to get started and keep full control over your data.

## TLDR

1. Install the Formbricks WordPress plugin
2. Create a [free Formbricks account](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)
3. Find and copy the `environment id`
4. Copy the environment id into the right field in the plugin settings
5. Create survey on trigger ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù to test it

## Step 1: Install the Formbricks WordPress plugin

As long as the Formbricks plugin is in review, please download it from our [GitHub repository directly.](https://github.com/formbricks/wordpress)

## Step 4: Copy the environmentId to the WordPress Plugin Settings

In your WordPress instance, go to the Formbricks Plugin settings and copy the environmentId in the correct field:

Then click the button at the bottom to see if the connection worked.

<Note>If you don‚Äôt use our Cloud, you also have to update the API Host</Note>

Great!

## Step 5: Create survey on trigger ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù

Now that all is setup, we create a survey to display an example survey. Pick any template here:

Keep the content for now, click on the Settings tab:

![Free and open source HotJar survey on WordPress page](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/wordpress/4-wordpress-website-survey-target-visitor-free.webp)


Here we do three things:

2. Select trigger ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù
3. Publish
