  Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at
  least one question and a Notion database in the Notion account you integrated.

1. Now click on the "Link New Database" button to link a Notion database with Formbricks and a modal will open up.

Congratulations! You have successfully linked a Notion database with Formbricks. Now whenever a response is submitted for the linked survey, it will be automatically added to the linked Notion database.

## Setup in self-hosted Formbricks

Enabling the Notion Integration in a self-hosted environment requires a setup using Notion account and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

1. Sign up for a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) account, if you don't have one already.

2. Go to the [my integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) page and click on **New integration**.

3. Fill up the basic information like **Name**, **Logo** and click on **Submit**.

4. Now, click on **Distribution** tab on the sidebar. A text will appear which will ask you to make the integration public. Click on that toggle button. A form will appear below the text.

5. Now provide it the details such as requested. Under **Redirect URIs** field:

   * If you are running formbricks locally, you can enter `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/integrations/notion/callback`.

   * Or, you can enter `https://<your-public-facing-url>/api/v1/integrations/notion/callback`

6. Once you've filled all the necessary details, click on **Submit**.

7. A screen will appear which will have **Client ID** and **Client secret**. Copy them and set them as the environment variables in your Formbricks instance as:

   * `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth Client ID

   * `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth Client Secret

Voila! You have successfully enabled the Notion integration in your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now you can follow the steps mentioned in the [Formbricks Cloud](#formbricks-cloud) section to link a Notion database with Formbricks.
