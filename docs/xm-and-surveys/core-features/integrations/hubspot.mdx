<Note>
  Formbricks doesn't have a native HubSpot integration yet. This guide shows you how to connect Formbricks with HubSpot using automation platforms (Make.com, n8n) or custom webhooks.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, you'll need:

1. **A Formbricks account** with at least one survey that collects email addresses
2. **A HubSpot account** with API access
3. **HubSpot API credentials** (see authentication options below)
4. **Automation service** like Make, n8n, or ActivePieces (for no-code methods)

### HubSpot Authentication Options

HubSpot offers two main ways to authenticate API requests:

#### Option A: OAuth 2.0 via Public App (Recommended)

OAuth is the recommended approach for production integrations. When using Make.com or n8n, they handle OAuth authentication for you through their built-in HubSpot connectors.

#### Option B: Legacy Private Apps (Simple Setup)

For custom webhook handlers, you can use a Legacy Private App which provides a static access token. While marked as "legacy," these apps remain fully supported by HubSpot.

To create a Legacy Private App:

1. Go to your HubSpot account **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Private Apps**
3. Click **Create a private app**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Formbricks Integration")
5. Under **Scopes**, add:
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
6. Click **Create app** and copy the access token

<Note>
  For more information on HubSpot's authentication options, see the [HubSpot Authentication Overview](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/intro-to-auth).
</Note>

## Method 1: Using Make.com (Recommended for No-Code)


### Step 1: Set Up Your Survey

Before creating the Make scenario, ensure your survey has clear `questionId` values set. This makes mapping responses to HubSpot fields easier.

<Note>
  You can only update `questionId` values before publishing. If your survey is already published, duplicate it and update the question IDs in the copy.
</Note>

### Step 2: Create a New Make.com Scenario

1. Go to [Make.com](https://make.com) and create a new scenario
2. Search for **Formbricks** and select it as your trigger
3. Choose **Response Finished** as the trigger event

![Search Formbricks](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/search-formbricks.webp)

### Step 3: Connect Formbricks to Make

1. Click **Create a webhook**
2. Enter your Formbricks API Host (default: `https://app.formbricks.com`)
3. Add your Formbricks API Key (see [API Key Setup](/api-reference/rest-api#how-to-generate-an-api-key))
4. Select the survey you want to connect

### Step 4: Add the HubSpot Module

1. Click the **+** button after the Formbricks trigger
2. Search for **HubSpot** and select it
3. Choose **Create or Update a Contact** as the action
4. Connect your HubSpot account

### Step 5: Map Formbricks Fields to HubSpot

Map the Formbricks response fields to HubSpot contact properties:

| HubSpot Field | Formbricks Field |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Email | `data.email` (your email question ID) |
| First Name | `data.firstName` (if collected) |
| Last Name | `data.lastName` (if collected) |
| Custom Property | Any other `data.*` field |

You can also map metadata from the response:

- **Country**: `meta.country`
- **Browser**: `meta.userAgent.browser`
- **Survey Name**: `survey.title`

### Step 6: Test and Activate

1. Submit a test response to your Formbricks survey
2. Verify the contact appears in HubSpot
3. Turn on your Make scenario

## Method 2: Using n8n (Self-Hosted Option)

<Note>
  The Formbricks n8n node is available as a community node. Install it via **Settings** → **Community Nodes** → install `@formbricks/n8n-nodes-formbricks`.
</Note>

### Step 1: Set Up the Formbricks Trigger

1. Create a new workflow in n8n
2. Add the **Formbricks** trigger node
3. Connect it with your Formbricks API Key and host
4. Select **Response Finished** as the event
5. Choose your survey

![Add Formbricks Trigger](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/n8n/add-formbricks-trigger.webp)

### Step 2: Add the HubSpot Node

1. Add a new node and search for **HubSpot**
2. Select **Create/Update Contact** as the operation
3. Connect your HubSpot account (n8n supports both OAuth and access token authentication)

### Step 3: Configure Field Mapping

In the HubSpot node, map the fields:

```
Email: {{ $json.data.email }}
First Name: {{ $json.data.firstName }}
Last Name: {{ $json.data.lastName }}
```

For custom HubSpot properties, use the **Additional Fields** section to add mappings like:

```
survey_source: {{ $json.survey.title }}
response_id: {{ $json.id }}
submission_date: {{ $json.createdAt }}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Workflow

1. Click **Listen for event** in the Formbricks trigger
2. Submit a test survey response
3. Verify the data flows through to HubSpot
4. Activate your workflow

## Method 3: Using Webhooks (Custom Integration)

For maximum flexibility, you can use Formbricks webhooks with a custom endpoint that calls the HubSpot API directly. This approach is ideal for developers who want full control.

<Note>
  This method requires a HubSpot access token. You can use a Legacy Private App token (simplest) or implement OAuth 2.0 for production applications.
</Note>

### Step 1: Create a Formbricks Webhook

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Integrations** in Formbricks
2. Click **Manage Webhooks** → **Add Webhook**
3. Enter your endpoint URL (see options below)
4. Select **Response Finished** as the trigger
5. Choose the surveys to monitor

### Step 2: Build Your Webhook Handler

Your webhook handler needs to:

1. **Receive the Formbricks webhook** - Accept POST requests with the survey response payload
2. **Extract contact data** - Parse the email and other fields from `data.data` (keyed by your `questionId` values)
3. **Call the HubSpot API** - Use the [HubSpot Contacts API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts) to create or update contacts
4. **Handle duplicates** - HubSpot returns a 409 error if a contact with that email exists; search and update instead

You can deploy your handler using:
- **Serverless functions** (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers)
- **Traditional servers** (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **Low-code platforms** (if Make.com or n8n don't meet your needs)

For webhook signature verification, see the [Webhooks documentation](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/webhooks).

### Step 3: Deploy and Test

1. Deploy your webhook handler to a publicly accessible URL
2. Add the URL to your Formbricks webhook configuration
3. Submit a test survey response
4. Verify the contact appears in HubSpot

## Troubleshooting

### Contact Not Created in HubSpot

1. **Check the email field**: Ensure your survey has an email question and you're mapping the correct `questionId`
2. **Verify API token**: Make sure your HubSpot access token has the required scopes (`crm.objects.contacts.write` and `crm.objects.contacts.read`)
3. **Check for duplicates**: HubSpot returns a 409 error if a contact with that email already exists

### Webhook Not Triggering

1. Verify the webhook URL is publicly accessible
2. Check that **Response Finished** trigger is selected
3. Ensure the survey is linked to the webhook

### Testing Your Integration

1. Use a unique test email for each test
2. Check HubSpot's **Contacts** page after submitting a response
3. Review your webhook handler logs for errors
