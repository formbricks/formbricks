description: "Each project on Formbricks has two environments: a test environment and a production environment. The test environment is used to test your surveys through before they are sent out to your customers."
---

To clearly separate between test and production data, Formbricks provides two different environments for each project. These environments are completely independent of each other **incl. API keys, project configuration and environment Id's** used for connecting Formbricks to run in-product surveys.

## Toggle between environments

You can switch between environments from the Website & App Connection settings (Configuration > Website & App Connection). At the top, you'll see a toggle button that says "Switch to development" (when in production) or "Switch to production" (when in development).


### Dev Environment (Testing)

The development environment is used to test your surveys and project configuration before deploying to production. When you're in development mode, you'll see a dark red breadcrumb labeled "development" at the top.


### Production Environment

The production environment is used to serve your surveys to your respondents.
