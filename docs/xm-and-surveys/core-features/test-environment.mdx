description: "Each project on Formbricks has two environments: a test environment and a production environment. The test environment is used to test your surveys through before they are sent out to your customers."
---

To clearly separate between test and production data, Formbricks provides two different environments for each project. These environments are completely independent of each other **incl. API keys, project configuration and environment Id's** used for connecting Formbricks to run in-product surveys.

## Toggle between environments

You can toggle between environments by clicking the environment name in the top right corner of the Formbricks app:

### Dev Environment (Testing)

The test environment is used to test your project before it goes live in the production environment. If you see an orange banner at the top, you are currently in the test environment:

### Production Environment

The production environment is used to serve your surveys to your respondents.
