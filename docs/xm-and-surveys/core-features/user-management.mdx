# Organization Access Roles

Learn about the different organization-level and team-level roles and how they affect permissions in Formbricks.

## Memberships

Permissions in Formbricks are broadly handled using organization-level roles, which apply to all teams and projects in the organization. Users on a self-hosting and Enterprise plan, have access to team-level roles, which enable more granular permissions.

<Note>
  Access Roles is a feature of the **Enterprise Edition**. In the **Community Edition** and on the **Free**
  and **Startup** plan in the Cloud you can invite unlimited organization members as `Owner`.
</Note>

Here are the different access permissions, ranked from highest to lowest access

1. Owner
2. Manager
3. Billing
4. Member

### Organisational level

All users and their organization-level roles are listed in **Organization Settings > General**. Users can hold any of the following org-level roles:

- **Owner** have full access to the organization, its data, and settings. Org Owners can perform Team Admin actions without needing to join the team.
- **Manager** have full management access to all teams and projects. They can also manage the organization's membership. Org Managers can perform Team Admin actions without needing to join the team. They cannot change other organization settings.
- **Billing** users can manage payment and compliance details in the organization.
- **Member** can view most data in the organization and act in the projects they are members of. They cannot join projects on their own and need to be assigned.

### Permissions at project level

- **Read**: Read access to all resources (except settings) in the project.
- **Read & write**: Read & write access to all resources (except settings) in the project.
- **Manage**: Read & write access to all resources including settings in the project.

### Team-level Roles

- **Team Contributors** can view and act on surveys and responses.
- **Team Admins** have additional permissions to manage their team's membership and projects. These permissions are granted at the team-level, and don't apply to teams where they're not a Team Admin.
