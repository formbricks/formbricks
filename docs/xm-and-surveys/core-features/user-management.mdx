Formbricks provides comprehensive user management capabilities to help you control access, organize teams, and secure your organization. This section covers everything you need to know about managing users, roles, and permissions.

## Key concepts

Formbricks uses a flexible permission system with multiple layers:

- **Organization roles** - Control access across the entire organization
- **Team roles** - Provide granular permissions within specific teams
- **Project permissions** - Fine-tune access to individual projects
- **Security features** - Protect accounts with two-factor authentication

<Note>
  Advanced user management features are part of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license). The Community Edition and Free/Startup Cloud plans support unlimited organization members with Owner permissions.
