When a user doesn't convert, you want to know why. A micro-survey displayed at exactly the right time gives you a window into understanding the most relevant question: To pay or not to pay?

## Purpose

Understanding why free users don‚Äôt convert to paid users helps boost revenue. This insight allows you to adjust your offering to encourage more users to upgrade.

## Formbricks Approach

- Ask at exactly the right point in time.
- Ask to understand the problem, don‚Äôt ask for solutions.

## Installation

To display the Trial Conversion Survey in your app you want to proceed as follows:

- Create new Trial Conversion Survey at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/).
- Set up the user action to display survey at right point in time.
- Print it.

<Note>

_Want to change the button color? Adjust it in the project settings!_

Save, and move over to the **Audience** tab.

### 3. Pre-segment your audience (coming soon)

<Note>
### Filter by Attribute Coming Soon

We're working on pre-segmenting users by attributes. This manual will be updated in the coming days.
</Note>

Pre-segmentation isn't needed for this survey since you likely want to target all users who cancel their trial. You can use a specific user action, like clicking **Cancel Trial**, to show the survey only to users trying your product.

### 4. Set up a trigger for the Trial Conversion Survey:

How you trigger your survey depends on your product. There are two options:

- **Trigger by Page view:** If you have a page like `/trial-cancelled` for users who cancel their trial subscription, create a user action with the type "Page View." Select "Limit to specific pages" and apply URL filters with these settings:

Whenever a user visits this page, the survey will be displayed ‚úÖ

- **Trigger by Button Click:** In a different case, you have a ‚ÄúCancel Trial" button in your app. You can setup a user Action with the `Inner Text`:

Please have a look at our complete [Actions manual](/product/website-app-surveys/actions) if you have questions.

### 5. Select Action in the ‚ÄúWhen to ask‚Äù card
