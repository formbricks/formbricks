Experience Management is the practice of measuring and managing how a stakeholder group of an organization (customers, employees, patients, citizens, etc...) experience the products or services of the organization.

Historically, Experience Management has three steps:

1. **Gather**

    data

2. **Analyze**

    and report on the data

3. **Integrate**

    and automate to measure experiences at scale

## Gather data

The heart of Formbricks data gathering is a powerful yet user-friendly survey builder. With a simple drag-and-drop interface, you can add questions, set response options, handle variables, set up complex logic and manage quotas. Our surveys have a modern look & feel, can be fully customized to match your brand - all while keeping respondent data safe.

## Analytics & Report

Formbricks gives you clear analytics and insights to understand user responses. It organizes survey results into easy-to-read formats, helping you spot trends, identify issues, and find opportunities for improvement. You can export your data to .csv or .xlsx or pipe it to your data lake via API.

We're working on a fully compliant way to leverage AI to harvest insights from unstructured data as well as a comprehensive reporting feature.

## Integrate & Automate

Experience Management scales best, when it is automated. Webhooks and the comprehensive REST API make it fast and easy to build integrations into your existing tech stack. Formbricks also powers integrations for n8n, ActivePieces, Zapier and Make.com to build any flow that you need.
