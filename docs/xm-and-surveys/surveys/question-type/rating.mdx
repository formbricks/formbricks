## CSAT Summary

After collecting responses, rating questions display a CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score with a visual traffic light indicator to help you quickly assess satisfaction levels:

- 🟢 **Green** (> 80%): High satisfaction - your users are very satisfied
- 🟠 **Orange** (55-80%): Moderate satisfaction - there's room for improvement
- 🔴 **Red** (< 55%): Low satisfaction - immediate attention needed

<Note>The traffic light indicator appears automatically in the survey summary view, giving you instant feedback on user satisfaction without needing to dig into the data.</Note>

### How CSAT is Calculated

The CSAT percentage represents the proportion of respondents who gave a "satisfied" rating. What counts as "satisfied" depends on your selected range:

| Range | Satisfied Ratings | Examples |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| 3 | Highest rating only | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 4 | Top 2 ratings | ⭐⭐⭐ or ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 5 | Top 2 ratings | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ or ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 6 | Top 2 ratings | 5 or 6 |
| 7 | Top 2 ratings | 6 or 7 |
| 10 | Top 3 ratings | 8, 9, or 10 |

<Note>
**Pro Tip:** For most use cases, a 5-point scale with star or smiley icons provides the best balance between granularity and user experience. Users find it easy to understand and quick to complete.
