## Overview

The email followup feature allows survey creators to automatically send customized emails to respondents based on their survey responses or when they reach specific survey endings. This feature is particularly useful for following up with respondents, sending thank you notes, or providing additional information.

<Note>
  Email followups is a paid feature. It is only available for users on paid plans or if you have [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license).
