## Set Hidden Field in Responses

### Link Surveys

Single Hidden Field:

```
  sh https://formbricks.com/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?screen=pricing 
```

Multiple Hidden Fields:

```
  sh https://formbricks.com/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?screen=landing_page&job=Founder
```

### App & Website Surveys

For in-product surveys, you can set hidden fields in the response by adding them to the `formbricks.track` call:

<Col>
  <CodeGroup title="Example Screen from which the User filled it">
    ```sh
    formbricks.track("my event", {
      hiddenFields: {
        screen: "landing_page",
        job: "Founder"
      },
    });
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Col>

## View Hidden Fields in Responses

These hidden fields will now be visible in the responses tab just like other fields in the Summary as well as the Response Cards, and you can use them to filter and analyze your responses.
