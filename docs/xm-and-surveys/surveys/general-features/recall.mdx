## Recall Sources

You can recall data from the following sources:

- From a previous question

- From a [Hidden Field](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/hidden-fields)

- From a [Variable](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/variables)

## Recalling from a previous question

<Note>
  The recall functionality is disabled on the first question of the survey since
  there’s no preceding question to recall data from.
</Note>

### **Pre-requisite**

Ensure the answer you wish to recall precedes the question in which it will be recalled. Here’s an example of setting up the first question:

### **Step 1: Recall Data**

Type **`@`** in the question or description field where you want to insert a recall. This triggers a dropdown menu listing all preceding questions. Select the question you want to recall data from.

### **Step 2: Set a Fallback**

To ensure the survey remains coherent when a response is missing (or the question is optional), you should set a fallback option.

## Recalling from the URL

1. Create a hidden field, [here is how →](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/hidden-fields)

2. Use the `@` symbol in a question or description to recall the value of the hidden field

3. Set a fallback in case the hidden field is not being filled by a URL parameter

4. Use [Data Prefilling](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/data-prefilling) to set the hidden field value when the survey is accessed

## Recalling from a Variable

1. Create a variable, [here is how →](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/variables)

2. Use the `@` symbol in a question or description to recall the value of the variable

3. Set a fallback in case the variable is not being filled by a URL parameter
