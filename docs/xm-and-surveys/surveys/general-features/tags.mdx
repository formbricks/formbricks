## What are Tags?

Tags are labels that you can apply to individual survey responses. They allow you to:

- Categorize responses by topic, sentiment, or any custom criteria
- Filter responses to find specific subsets of data
- Track and organize feedback across multiple surveys
- Simplify analysis and reporting workflows

Tags are environment-specific, meaning each environment maintains its own set of tags.

## Add tags to responses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to responses">
    Go to the **Responses** tab of your survey.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open a response">
    Click on any response card to view the full response details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a tag">
    At the bottom of the response card, click the **Add Tag** button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select or create a tag">
    - Select an existing tag from the dropdown list, or
    - Type a new tag name and click **+ Add [tag name]** to create a new tag
  </Step>
</Steps>

The tag will be immediately applied to the response. You can add multiple tags to a single response.

## Remove tags from responses

To remove a tag from a response:

1. Open the response card
2. Click the **X** icon on the tag you want to remove

The tag will be removed from the response immediately.

## Manage tags

Access the tag management page to view and organize all tags in your environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Configuration">
    Click on **Project Configuration** > **Tags**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View all tags">
    You'll see a list of all tags in your environment with their usage count showing how many responses have each tag applied.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Edit tag names

1. In the tag management page, click on the tag name field
2. Edit the name directly
3. Click outside the field or press Enter to save

<Note>
Tag names must be unique within an environment. If you try to use an existing tag name, you'll receive an error.
</Note>

### Merge tags

Merging tags is useful when you have duplicate or similar tags that you want to consolidate.

1. In the tag management page, find the tag you want to merge
2. Click the **Merge into** dropdown
3. Select the destination tag
4. Confirm the merge

All responses tagged with the original tag will be updated to use the destination tag, and the original tag will be deleted.

### Delete tags

1. In the tag management page, find the tag you want to delete
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a tag will remove it from all responses. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Filter responses by tags

Use tags to filter and find specific responses in your survey analysis.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open filters">
    In the **Responses** tab, click the **Filter** button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select tag filter">
    Scroll to the **Tags** section and select a tag from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose filter type">
    Choose whether to filter by:
    - **Applied**: Show only responses that have this tag
    - **Not Applied**: Show only responses that don't have this tag
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View filtered results">
    The response list will update to show only responses matching your tag filter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can combine tag filters with other filters (questions, attributes, metadata) to create complex filter criteria.

## Use cases

Here are some common ways to use tags:

- **Sentiment tracking**: Tag responses as "positive", "negative", or "neutral"
- **Follow-up needed**: Mark responses that require action with a "follow-up" tag
- **Feature requests**: Categorize feedback by product area or feature
- **Customer segments**: Tag responses by customer type, industry, or plan level
- **Priority levels**: Mark critical issues with "urgent" or "high-priority" tags
- **Review status**: Track which responses have been reviewed with "reviewed" or "pending" tags

## Permissions

Tag management requires appropriate permissions:

- **View tags**: All users with access to the environment can view tags on responses
- **Add/remove tags on responses**: Users with read-write access can apply and remove tags
- **Manage tags** (create, edit, merge, delete): Users with project team read-write permission or organization owner/manager roles
