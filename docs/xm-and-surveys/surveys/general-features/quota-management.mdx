## Overview

Quota Management allows you to set limits on the number of responses collected for specific segments or criteria in your survey. This feature helps ensure you collect a balanced and representative dataset while preventing oversaturation of certain response types.

<Note type="warning">
  Quota Management is currently in beta and only available to select customers.

<Note>
  Quota Management is part of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license).

### Key benefits

- **Balanced Data Collection**: Ensure your survey responses are evenly distributed across different segments
- **Cost Control**: Prevent collecting more responses than needed from specific groups
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain data quality by avoiding homogeneous response patterns
- **Automated Management**: Automatically stop collecting responses when quotas are met

### How Quota Management works

When you set up quotas for your survey, Formbricks automatically tracks responses against your defined limits. Once a quota is reached, the system can:

- Prevent new responses from that segment
- Skip respondents to the end of the survey
- Redirect respondents to a custom end screen

## Setting up Quotas
In the first step, you need to define the criteria for the quota:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name the quota">
    Create a Quota and label it e.g. "Mobile Phone Users in Europe"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set quota limit">
    Set numerical limits for each hidden field value combination e.g. 500
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define inclusion criteria">
    Choose a distinct set of answers to survey questions, variable values or hidden fields. Responses who match this set will be included in the quota. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure actions">
    Choose what happens when this Quota is met (e.g. skip to specific end screen)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quota actions
Configure what happens when a quota reaches its limit:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Skip to End">
    Jump respondents directly to the survey completion page
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Redirect (soon)">
    Redirect respondents to a custom thank you page or alternative survey
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Counting against Quotas

### 1. Count by Hidden Field value

Determine if a response falls in or out of a Quota based on hidden field values passed through URL parameters:

```
https://your-survey-url.com/s/abc123?product=credit-card&region=europe
```

### 2. Quota by survey responses

Create quotas based on specific answers to survey questions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Question Quota">
    Set quotas for individual answer options:
    - Question: "What is your gender?"
    - Quota: 500 responses for "Male", 500 responses for "Female"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multi-Question Quota">
    Combine multiple question responses:
    - Criteria: Age group "25-34" AND Location "Urban"
    - Quota: 200 responses matching both criteria
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Multi-criteria quotas

Create complex quotas using multiple conditions:

<CodeGroup>
```example "Hidden Field + Response Combination"
Hidden Field: product = "mobile"
AND
Question Response: satisfaction = "very satisfied"
```

```example "Multiple Response Criteria"
Question 1: age_group = "18-25"
AND
Question 2: location = "urban"
AND
Question 3: income = "high"
Quota Limit: 50 responses
```
</CodeGroup>

### Partial vs. complete responses

<Info>
  By default, Quota Management includes partial responses in quota counts. You can change this behavior by configuring the quota to only count complete responses.
</Info>

This means if a respondent starts but doesn't complete the survey, they may still count toward your quota if they've answered the qualifying questions.

## Quota monitoring
