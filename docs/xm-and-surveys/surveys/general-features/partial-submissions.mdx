## **Understanding Partial Submissions**

Partial submissions occur when respondents start a survey but do not complete it. These can include instances where the survey is opened but no questions are answered, or where only some questions are addressed before the survey is exited.

## **Enabling and Accessing Partial Submissions Tracking**

Tracking of partial submissions is automatically enabled for all Formbricks surveys, capturing every interaction from the moment a respondent begins the survey.

### **Types of Data Captured**

1. **Display Created**: Tracks when a survey is initially opened.

2. **Questions Partially Answered**: Records after every question & the data is handled, noting which questions were last interacted with before the survey was exited.

### **Benefits of Tracking Partial Submissions**

- **Identifies Drop-Off Points**: Pinpoints specific questions where respondents are likely to stop answering, providing critical insights into potential issues within the survey.

- **Improves Survey Design**: Data from partial submissions can guide adjustments to question complexity, survey length, or formatting to enhance respondent engagement.

- **Enhances Completion Rates**: Understanding where and why respondents are dropping off allows for targeted interventions to improve overall engagement and completion rates.

## **Analyzing Partial Submission Data**

Formbricks provides detailed analytics for partial submissions, including a per-question analysis of respondent behavior.

### **Survey Summary Analytics**

The "Analyze Drop-Offs" toggle in the survey summary reveals a comprehensive table with detailed metrics, enabling a deep dive into how respondents interact with each question:

- **Summary Metrics**:

  - **Impressions**: Total number of times the survey was viewed.

  - **Starts**: Percentage of impressions that the survey was started.

  - **Responses**: Total number of completed responses.

  - **Drop-Offs**: Percentage of starts that did not lead to a complete response.

  - **Time to Complete**: Average time taken by respondents to complete the survey.

### **Detailed Question Analysis**

Each question is analyzed for:

- **Time to Complete**: Average time taken by respondents spent on this question.

- **Impressions**: Number of times the question was viewed.

- **Drop-Offs**: Number of times respondents left the survey at this question, with a percentage indicating the drop-off rate.

This data is invaluable for pinpointing problems with specific questions and understanding the overall flow and engagement levels within the survey.

## **Use Cases**

Partial submissions tracking is particularly valuable for:

- Surveys experiencing high drop-off rates, where detailed question analysis can inform necessary adjustments.

- Studies requiring in-depth engagement metrics for each survey question to optimize content and survey structure.

## **Conclusion**

By leveraging the partial submissions tracking feature in Formbricks, you gain comprehensive insights into respondent behaviors and survey interactions. This information is vital for enhancing survey design, improving response rates, and ensuring more reliable and meaningful data collection.
