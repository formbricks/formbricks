title: "User Metadata"
description: "Formbricks captures metadata of your users for you when they fill a survey. This metadata is useful for understanding the context in which the user filled the survey. For example, if you are running a marketing campaign, you can understand which source is driving the most responses. Or if you are running a survey on a specific page, you can understand the user's behavior on that page."
