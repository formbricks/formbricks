# Creating a Research Panel with Prolific

You need a lot of research participants that match your target audience fast?

Formbricks integrates well with Prolific. Prolific provides a pool of over 200.000 research participants you can choose from. Run market research with Formbricks within hours, not days.

<Note>
  Prolific is a paid service. You need to fund your account to access the pool
  of participants. The cost depends on the number of participants you want to
  reach and the demographics you're targeting. You can get an estimate of the
  cost with the [Prolific price calculator](https://www.prolific.com/calculator)
</Note>

## Purpose

External research panels are useful when:

- You don't have access to enough people who match your target audience
- You want to reach a specific demographic
- You want to reach a large number of people quickly

## Steps to Follow

### Step 1: Add hidden fields to the Formbricks survey

To be able to attribute a completed answer to a research participant, you need to add hidden fields to your Formbricks survey. To do so, edit your survey and scroll down to the Hidden Fields card.

Add three fields with the IDs `PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, and `SESSION_ID`.

### Step 2: Create an account on Prolific

Go to [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/) and create an account.

### Step 3: Create a study on Prolific

Once you're logged in to Prolific, create a new study.

### Step 4: Copy the Formbricks survey link to the Prolific study

We connect the Formbricks survey with the Prolific study by copying the survey link from Formbricks and pasting it into the Prolific study:

### Step 5: Choose URL parameters for attribution

To attribute responses to the correct participant, you need to add URL parameters to the Formbricks survey link. The parameters are `PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, and `SESSION_ID`, exactly like the hidden fields you added.

### Step 6: Update the Formbricks Redirect URL

To ensure that participants are redirected back to Prolific after completing the survey, add the redirect URL provided in the Prolific study setup (e.g. `https://app.prolific.co/submissions/complete?cc=I2PWSFRG`)

Copy from Prolific:

![Copy redirect URL](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/redirect-url.webp)

Set it up as Redirect URL in the Response Options in Formbricks:
