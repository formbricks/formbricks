  "URL Data Prefilling for Link Surveys in Formbricks"
icon: "fill"
---

Data prefilling via the URL allows you to increase completion rate by prefilling data you already have in a different system. Formbricks allows you to prefill multiple questions in a survey and skip prefilled questions.

## Purpose

Data prefilling via URL comes in handy when you:

- Have data for some of the respondents, but not all
- Have data you want the respondent to confirm or update
- Have data in a different system (e.g. your database) and want to add it to the user profile in Formbricks
- Want to embed a survey in an email and increase completion by prefilling the choice selected in the email

## Quick Example

```sh Example URL
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?question_id_1=answer_1&question_id_2=answer_2&skipPrefilled=true
```

## How it works

1. To prefill survey questions, add query parameters to the survey URL using the format `questionId=answer`. 
2. For choice-based questions, you can use either **option IDs** (recommended) or **option labels** (backward compatible).
3. The answer must match the question's expected type to pass [validation](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/data-prefilling#validation).
4. The answer needs to be [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) (if it contains spaces or special characters)

### Option IDs vs Option Labels

- **Option IDs (Recommended):** Use the unique ID of each option. These don't change with translations and are more reliable. Example: `?country=choice-us`
- **Option Labels (Backward Compatible):** Use the exact text of the option. Example: `?country=United%20States`

If you provide a value that matches an option ID, it will be used. Otherwise, the system will try to match it as an option label.


### Skip prefilled questions

You can skip prefilled questions by adding the `skipPrefilled` parameter in the URL. To skip prefilled questions and show the next available question, add `skipPrefilled=true` to the URL. By default, `skipPrefilled` is set to `false`.

```sh Skipping prefilled questions
app.formbricks.com/s/clin3dxj?question_id_1=answer_1&skipPrefilled=true
```

### Prefilling multiple values

Formbricks lets you prefill as many values as you want. Combine multiple values in the URL using `&`, for example: `name=Bernadette&age=18`. The order of query parameters doesn’t matter, so you can move questions around or add new ones without worrying about the parameter order.

### Where do I find my question Id?

You can find the `questionId` in the **Advanced Settings** at the bottom of each question card in the Survey Editor. You can update the `questionId` to any string you like **before you publish a survey.** After you published a survey, you cannot change the id anymore.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started:

### Rating Question

Translates to 5 stars / points / emojis:

```sh Rating Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?rating_question_id=5
```

### NPS Question

Translates to an NPS rating of 10:

```sh NPS Questions
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?nps_question_id=10
```

### Single Select Question (Radio)

Chooses the option 'Very disappointed' in the single select question. The string has to be identical to the option in your question:

```sh Single-select Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?single_select_question_id=Very%20disappointed
```

### Multi Select Question (Checkbox)

Selects multiple options in the multi select question using comma-separated values. You can use either option IDs or labels:

**Using Option IDs (Recommended):**
```sh Multi-select Question (by ID)
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?multi_select_question_id=sport%2Cmusic%2Ctravel
```

**Using Option Labels (Backward Compatible):**
```sh Multi-select Question (by Label)
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?multi_select_question_id=Sun%2CPalms%2CBeach
```

### Open Text Question

Adds 'I love Formbricks' as the answer to the open text question:

```sh Open Text Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?openText_question_id=I%20love%20Formbricks
```

### CTA Question

Accepts only 'dismissed' as answer option. Due to the risk of domain abuse, this value cannot be set to 'clicked' via prefilling:

```txt CTA Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?cta_question_id=dismissed
```

<Note>
  Due to the risk of domain abuse, this value cannot be set to 'clicked' via prefilling.
</Note>

### Consent Question

Adds 'accepted' as the answer to the Consent question. Alternatively, you can set it to 'dismissed' to skip the question.

```txt Consent Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?consent_question_id=accepted
```

### Picture Selection Question

Selects image options in the Picture Selection question using comma-separated option IDs:

```txt Picture Selection Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?pictureSelection_question_id=choice-1%2Cchoice-2%2Cchoice-3
```

### Ranking Question

Orders items in a Ranking question using comma-separated option IDs. The order matters and determines the rank:

```txt Ranking Question (order matters)
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?ranking_question_id=item-3%2Citem-1%2Citem-2
```

<Note>The order of comma-separated values determines the ranking order.</Note>

<Note>All other question types, you currently cannot prefill via the URL.</Note>

## Validation

Make sure that the answer in the URL matches the expected type for the questions.

The URL validation works as follows:

- For Rating or NPS questions, the response is parsed as a number and verified if it's accepted by the schema.
- For CTA type questions, the valid values are "clicked" (main CTA) and "dismissed" (skip CTA).
- For Consent type questions, the valid values are "accepted" (consent given) and "dismissed" (consent not given).
- For Picture Selection, Multi-select, and Ranking questions, the response can be comma-separated option IDs or labels.
- For choice-based questions (Single-select, Multi-select, Ranking, Picture Selection), the system will first try to match as an option ID, then fallback to matching as an option label.
- All other question types are strings.

<Note>
  If an answer is invalid, the prefilling will be ignored and the question is
  presented as if not prefilled.
</Note>

## Finding Option IDs

Option IDs are unique identifiers for each choice option in your survey. You can find them in the **Advanced Settings** at the bottom of each question card in the Survey Editor. For choice-based questions (Single-select, Multi-select, Ranking, Picture Selection), the option ID is displayed next to each option.

You can update option IDs to any string you like **before you publish a survey.** After you publish a survey, you cannot change the IDs anymore.
