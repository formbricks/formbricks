  "URL Data Prefilling for Link Surveys in Formbricks"
icon: "fill"
---

Data prefilling via the URL allows you to increase completion rate by prefilling data you already have in a different system. Formbricks allows you to prefill multiple questions in a survey.

## Purpose

Data prefilling via URL comes in handy when you:

- Have data for some of the respondents, but not all
- Have data you want the respondent to confirm or update
- Have data in a different system (e.g. your database) and want to add it to the user profile in Formbricks
- Want to embed a survey in an email and increase completion by prefilling the choice selected in the email

## Quick Example

```sh Example URL
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?question_id_1=answer_1&question_id_2=answer_2
```

## How it works

To prefill survey questions, add query parameters to the survey URL using the format `questionId=answer`. The answer must match the question’s expected type to pass [validation](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/data-prefilling#validation).

<Note>
  Please make sure the answer is [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/).
</Note>

## Prefilling Customisation

You can customise the prefilling behaviour using the `skipPrefilled` parameter in the URL. To skip prefilled questions and show the next available question, add `skipPrefilled=true` to the URL. By default, `skipPrefilled` is set to `false`.

## Prefilling multiple values

Formbricks lets you prefill as many values as you want. Combine multiple values in the URL using `&`, for example: `name=Bernadette&age=18`. The order of query parameters doesn’t matter, so you can move questions around or add new ones without worrying about the parameter order.

## Where do I find my question Id?

You can find the `questionId` in the **Advanced Settings** at the bottom of each question card in the Survey Editor. You can update the `questionId` to any string you like. However, once you publish your survey, the `questionId` cannot be changed.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started:

### Rating Question

Translates to 5 stars / points / emojis:

```sh Rating Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?rating_question_id=5
```

### NPS Question

Translates to an NPS rating of 10:

```sh NPS Questions
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?nps_question_id=10
```

### Single Select Question (Radio)

Chooses the option 'Very disappointed' in the single select question. The string has to be identical to the option in your question:

```sh Single-select Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?single_select_question_id=Very%20disappointed
```

### Multi Select Question (Checkbox)

Selects three options 'Sun, Palms and Beach' in the multi select question. The strings have to be identical to the options in your question:

```sh Multi-select Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?multi_select_question_id=Sun%2CPalms%2CBeach
```

### Open Text Question

Adds 'I love Formbricks' as the answer to the open text question:

```sh Open Text Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?openText_question_id=I%20love%20Formbricks
```

### CTA Question

Adds 'clicked' as the answer to the CTA question. Alternatively, you can set it to 'dismissed' to skip the question:

```txt CTA Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?cta_question_id=clicked
```

### Consent Question

Adds 'accepted' as the answer to the Consent question. Alternatively, you can set it to 'dismissed' to skip the question.

```txt Consent Question
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?consent_question_id=accepted
```

### Picture Selection Question

Adds index of the selected image(s) as the answer to the Picture Selection question. The index starts from 1

```txt Picture Selection Question.
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?pictureSelection_question_id=1%2C2%2C3
```

<Note>All other question types, you currently cannot prefill via the URL.</Note>

## Validation

Make sure that the answer in the URL matches the expected type for the questions.

The URL validation works as follows:

- For Rating or NPS questions, the response is parsed as a number and verified if it's accepted by the schema.
- For CTA type questions, the valid values are "clicked" (main CTA) and "dismissed" (skip CTA).
- For Consent type questions, the valid values are "accepted" (consent given) and "dismissed" (consent not given).
- For Picture Selection type questions, the response is parsed as an array of numbers and verified if it's accepted by the schema.
- All other question types are strings.

<Note>
  If an answer is invalid, the prefilling will be ignored and the question is
  presented as if not prefilled.
