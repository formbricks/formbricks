## When to use Personal Links

Personal Links are ideal when you need to:

- **Track individual responses**: Associate survey responses with specific contacts in your database
- **Enable targeted follow-ups**: Know exactly who responded and who didn't for personalized outreach
- **Control survey access**: Set expiry dates to limit when links can be used
- **Maintain data integrity**: Ensure each contact can only submit one response per survey

## How Personal Links work

When you generate personal links:

1. **Individual URLs**: Each contact receives a unique survey link tied to their contact record
2. **Automatic attribution**: Responses are automatically linked to the specific contact who clicked the link
3. **Single-use by default**: Each link can only be used once to prevent duplicate responses
4. **Expiry control**: Set expiration dates to control survey access windows

## Generating Personal Links

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the share modal">
    Navigate to your survey and click the **Share survey** button in the top bar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Personal Links tab">
    In the Share Modal, click on the **Personal Links** tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose your segment">
    Select the contact segment you want to generate links for using the dropdown menu.
    
    <Note>
    If no segments are available, you'll see "No segments available" in the dropdown. Create segments first in your Contact Management section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set expiry date (optional)">
    Choose an expiry date for your links. You can only select dates starting from tomorrow onwards.
    
    <Warning>
    Links expire at 00:00:00 UTC on the day after your selected date. This means links remain valid through the entirety of your chosen expiry date.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate and download">
    Click **Generate & download links** to create your personal links and download them as a CSV file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the CSV export

Your downloaded CSV file contains the following columns in this order:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Formbricks Contact ID** | Internal contact identifier (`contactId`) |
| **Custom ID** | Your custom user identifier (`userId`) |
| **First Name** | Contact's first name |
| **Last Name** | Contact's last name |
| **Email** | Contact's email address |
| **Personal Link** | Unique survey URL for this contact |

<Tip>
Use the Custom ID column to match contacts with your existing systems, and the Personal Link column for distribution via your preferred communication channels.
</Tip>

## Limitations and considerations

<Warning>
Keep these limitations in mind when using Personal Links
</Warning>

- **Single-use only**: Each personal link can only be used once
- **Enterprise feature**: Requires EE license with Contact Management enabled
- **Segment requirement**: You must have contacts organized in segments
- **CSV storage**: Generated link lists are not retained in Formbricks - download and store your CSV files securely

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues
