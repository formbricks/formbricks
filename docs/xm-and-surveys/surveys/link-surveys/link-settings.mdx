## What are Link Settings?

Link Settings allow you to configure the metadata (Open Graph tags) for your survey links, controlling how they appear when shared:

- **Link Title**: The headline that appears when your link is shared
- **Link Description**: A brief description of your survey
- **Preview Image**: A custom image that displays alongside your link preview
