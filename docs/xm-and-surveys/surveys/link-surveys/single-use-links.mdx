This guide will help you understand how to generate and use single-use links within our application.

## Purpose

- Single-use links (or one-time / disposable links) are URLs that grant access to a survey only once.

- The primary purpose of single-use links is to assure that no respondent submits a survey twice.

<Note>
  Want to create up to 5,000 single-use links? Use our [API endpoint for
  that.](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#c49ef758-a78a-4ef4-a282-262621151f08)

## How to use single-use links

Using single-use links with Formbricks is quite straight-forward:

1. On the Summary page, hit "Share survey" in the top right corner to open the sharing modal.

2. Toggle "Single Use Link" on in the Anonymous Links tab:

   ![Single use link survey settings](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links/single-use-links.webp)

3. If you'd like to use URL encryption, toggle "URL Encryption" on. You can then customize the number of links you'd like to generate and download as CSV.

4. If you'd like to set a custom single-use ID, deactivate the "Enable URL Encryption" toggle. You can then customize the single-use ID in the URL or programmatically.

## Check suId of a submission

You can find the suId of each submission in the submission meta data. You'll find it both in the table as well as in the meta data when hovering over the Avatar:
