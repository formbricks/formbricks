This guide will help you understand how to generate and use single-use links within our application.

## Purpose

- Single-use links (or one-time / disposable links) are URLs that grant access to a survey only once.

- The primary purpose of single-use links is to assure that no respondent submits a survey twice.

<Note>
  Want to create up to 5,000 single-use links? Use our [API endpoint for
  that.](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#c49ef758-a78a-4ef4-a282-262621151f08)

## How to use single-use links

Using single-use links with Formbricks is quite straight-forward:

1. In the survey settings, toggle "Single Use Link" on:

   ![Single use survey settings](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links/single-use-setting.webp)

2. When you publish your survey, the following modal will open:

   ![Share modal with 7 single use links which can be regenerated](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links/share-modal.webp)

   Here, you can copy and generate as many single-use links as you need.

## URL encryption

You can encrypt single use URLs to assure information to be protected. To enable it, you have to set the correct environment variable:

![Set the right env var to be able to enable encryption.](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links/env-variable.webp)

## Check suId of a submission

You can find the suId of each submission in the submission meta data. To view it, simple hover over the Avatar:

### 'Link used' message

You can customize the 'link used' messaging in the Survey Editor settings:

![Adjust the message shown to people if a link was already used.](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links/used-message.webp)
