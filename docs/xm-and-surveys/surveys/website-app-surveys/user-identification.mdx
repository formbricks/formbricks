### Understanding Identified vs Unidentified Users

In Formbricks, understanding the difference between identified and unidentified users is crucial for effective survey segmentation and targeted feedback collection.

| Feature                                                  | Unidentified Users | Identified Users |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Show surveys based on **trigger** actions                | ✅                 | ✅               |
| Set **recontact details** to avoid survey fatique        | ✅                 | ✅               |
| Target a subset of users using **attributes & segments** | ❌                 | ✅               |
| Collect **user information** in Formbricks               | ❌                 | ✅               |
| Track **custom attributes**                              | ❌                 | ✅               |
| Counts towards your **monthly tacked user (MTU)** limit  | ❌                 | ✅               |
| Recommended for **public-facing websites**               | ✅                 | ❌               |
| Recommended for **web apps after login**                 | ❌                 | ✅               |

## Identified Users

Identified users are those for whom specific information has been set, notably the userId. This identification allows for more precise targeting of surveys and a deeper understanding of the feedback provided. When enabled, all information specified by you and all actions are sent to Formbricks.

This method is recommended for applications where users are required to log in and will often return.

### Setting User ID

To enable user identification, set the `userId` in the `init()` call of Formbricks. The user will show up in the Formbricks dashboard only if the `userId` is set. Use a unique string, like a database ID or a unique email address. You can also anonymize the identifier, as long as it is unique for each user.

```javascript
formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user_id>",
});
```

### Enhanced Initialization with User Attributes

Set user attributes in Formbricks during initialization along with the `userId`.

    ```javascript Enhanced Initialization with User Attributes
    formbricks.init({
      environmentId: "<environment-id>",
      apiHost: "<api-host>",
      userId: "<user_id>",
      attributes: {
        // your custom attributes
        Plan: "premium",
      },
    });
    ```

## Setting Custom User Attributes

Use the `setAttribute` function to set custom attributes for the user (e.g., name, plan).

<Note>
  **Note**: the number of different attribute classes (e.g., "Plan,"
  "First Name," etc.) is currently limited to 150 attributes per environment.
</Note>

```javascript Setting Custom Attributes 
formbricks.setAttribute("Plan","free");
 ```

The `setAttribute` function works like this:


```javascript Setting Custom Attributes
formbricks.setAttribute("attribute_key", "attribute_value");
```


### Logging Out Users

When a user logs out of your webpage, also log them out of Formbricks to prevent activity from being linked to the wrong user. Use the logout function:

```javascript Logging out User 
formbricks.logout(); 
```
