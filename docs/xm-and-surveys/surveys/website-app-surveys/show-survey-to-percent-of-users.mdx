  functions, which may result in slight variations in the exact percentage of
  users who see the survey.
</Note>

### **Example Usage**

For instance, if you want to expose your survey to only half of your targeted user base, simply adjust the slider to show the survey to 50% of your users. This functionality allows you to conduct A/B testing or control the rollout of new surveys to gauge initial reactions before a wider release.

### **Application**

It's effective for:

* **A/B Testing**: Compare different user experiences by showing different surveys or survey variations to different segments of your audience.

* **Gradual Rollouts**: Gradually introduce a new survey to a portion of your users to monitor initial responses and adjust based on feedback before full deployment.

* **Load Management**: Manage server load and response processing by limiting the number of responses collected at any given time.

## **Conclusion**

Using the **Show Survey to % of Users** feature allows for precise control over who sees your Formbricks surveys, making it an invaluable feature for targeted data collection and user experience management. By adjusting survey visibility settings, you can strategically engage segments of your audience, enhance survey testing phases, and optimize overall survey effectiveness.
