* **Create a Formbricks Cloud Account**: While you can [self-host](/self-hosting) Formbricks, the fastest and easiest way to get started is with the free Cloud plan. Simply [sign up](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup) here, follow the onboarding steps, and choose the "Formbricks Surveys” option.![what are you here for](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738113228/image_d11uiy.png)

* **Choose your project channel**: Select the channel where you want to create your project. You can create both app and link surveys from any channel, but for onboarding, select between app surveys or the public website option. Once selected, you'll be prompted to connect your app/website to Formbricks.

* **Connect your App/Website**: During onboarding, you'll be prompted to connect your app or website. You'll receive a code snippet for HTML and an npm package to embed in your app.

* **Create your first survey**: To be able to see a survey in your app, you need to create one. We’ll choose one of the templates and head over to the survey settings:

Pick the Survey Type as **App Survey**.

* **Set Trigger for the Survey**: Scroll to **Survey Trigger**, click **+ Add Action**, and select **New Session**. This ensures the survey appears when the Formbricks Widget detects a new user session.

![add action](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738115544/image_hj6hbf.jpg)

* **Set Recontact Options for Debugging**: Adjust the **Recontact Options** to test the survey more easily. By default, surveys appear only once per user to prevent fatigue.

<Note>
  Please change this setting after testing your survey to avoid user fatigue.
