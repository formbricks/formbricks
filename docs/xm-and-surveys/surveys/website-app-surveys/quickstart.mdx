<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Formbricks cloud account">
    While you can [self-host](/self-hosting) Formbricks, the fastest and easiest way to get started is with the free Cloud plan. Simply [sign up](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup) here, follow the onboarding steps, and choose the "Formbricks Surveys" option.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose 'In-product surveys'">
    You can create In-product and Link Surveys with both options, but the onboarding will prompt you to connect your app/website to Formbricks.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your App/Website">
 Follow the instructions to connect your app or website:
    ![connect product to formbricks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738114328/image_tv0jmj.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm setup">
    As soon as Formbricks receives the first data point, you will see a message in the onboarding:

    ![congrats](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738114793/image_lij7kw.png)
    
    Onboarding is complete! Now let's create our first survey as you should see templates to choose from after clicking on **Next**:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first survey">
    To be able to see a survey in your app, you need to create one. We'll choose one of the templates and head over to the survey settings:

    Pick the Survey Type as **Website & App Survey**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create trigger to show survey">
    Scroll to **Survey Trigger**, click **+ Add Action**, and select **Page View**. This ensures the survey appears when the Formbricks Widget detects any page load.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Recontact Options right">
  A common hiccup is users seeing one survey but it doesn't appear again. This is due to the default settings we chose to avoid survey fatigue. While setting up, we recommend the following Recontact Options:
  ![recontact options](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/quickstart/recontact-options.webp)

    <Note>
      Please change this setting after testing your survey to avoid user fatigue.
    </Note>
  </Step>


  <Step title="Publish the survey">
  Publish the survey to make it available for the SDK to pull into the website or app where you want to show it.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Enable debug mode in website / app">
  For better scalability, we cache the request the SDK makes to the server. This allows you to use Formbricks on websites with millions of visitors without high hosting cost. On the downside, there can be **up to a 10 minute delay** until the SDK pulls the newest surveys from the server.
  
  To avoid the delay, please switch on the [Debug Mode.](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/framework-guides#activate-debug-mode)
