Formbricks is an open-source (AGPLv3) survey platform built to collect feedback from anyone—users, customers, or employees—on any platform.

With Formbricks, you can replace many existing survey tools:

- **Standalone surveys (share via link):** Replace Google Forms, Typeform or any other link survey tool [with Formbricks Form Builder](https://formbricks.com/open-source-form-builder). Use lots of question types and comprehensive customizations.

- **Scalable website surveys:** Even if you have millions of website visitors, Formbricks lets you run well-timed and anonymously targeted [surveys on any public website.](https://formbricks.com/website-survey)

- **Highly targeted app surveys:** Identify known users with Formbricks and enrich their profiles with attributes and specific actions. Build cohorts for [highly targeted in-app surveys.](https://formbricks.com/in-app-survey)

The survey platform is **mostly free, even for commercial use**. Over time, all survey features will stay part of the free Community Edition.

### Formbricks – The Experience Management (XM) Suite

To support the development of our open-source platform, we’ve created a premium offering: the **Formbricks XM Suite**.

- **What is XM?**
  Experience Management (XM) involves collecting, analysing, and reporting feedback from stakeholders (like customers or employees) to understand and improve their experience with your organisation.

- **Why XM Matters**
  Helping businesses, governments, and nonprofits understand their users' experiences leads to better services and happier people. Formbricks XM provides the data needed to make decisions that put people first.

- **How XM Works in Formbricks**
  Formbricks XM simplifies experience management. It focuses only on what’s needed to measure specific experiences, with easy-to-use templates, reports, and best practices.

We have spent a lot of time and energy building out the open-source survey platform which powers the above. Stick around to see how Formbricks XM Apps will empower everyone to think and work human-centric.
