Formbricks provides two APIs: the Public Client API for frontend survey interactions and the Management API for backend management tasks."
---

Formbricks offers two types of APIs: the **Public Client API** and the **Management API**. Each API serves a different purpose, has *different* authentication requirements, and provides access to different data and settings.


## Public Client API

The **Public Client API** is used by our SDKs and doesn’t require authentication, making it ideal for client-side interactions without exposing sensitive data.

We currently have the following Client API methods exposed and below is their documentation attached in Postman:

- [Displays API](/api-reference/client-api->-display/create-display) - Mark a survey as displayed or link a display to a response for a person.

- [Contacts API](/api-reference/client-api->-contacts/update-contact-attributes) - Update contact attributes.

- [Responses API](/api-reference/client-api->-response/create-response) - Create & Update a Response for a Survey.

## Management API

The **Management API** gives full access to all data and settings available in your Formbricks account. It requires a personal API Key for authentication, which you can generate and manage in the Settings section of the Formbricks app.

We currently have the following Management API methods exposed and below is their documentation attached in Postman:

- [Action Class API](/api-reference/management-api->-action-class/get-all-action-classes) - Create, List, and Delete Action Classes

- [Attribute Class API ](/api-reference/management-api->-attribute-class/get-all-attribute-classes)- Create, List, and Delete Attribute Classes

- [Me API](/api-reference/management-api->-me/me) - Retrieve Account Information

- [People API](/api-reference/management-api->-people/get-all-persons) - List and Delete People

- [Response API](/api-reference/management-api->-response/get-survey-responses) - List, List by Survey, Update, and Delete Responses

- [Survey API](/api-reference/management-api->-survey/get-all-surveys) - List, Create, Update, generate multiple suId, and Delete Surveys

- [Webhook API](/api-reference/management-api->-webhook/get-all-webhooks) - List, Create, and Delete Webhooks
