Formbricks uses PostgreSQL as its primary database and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. The database schema is designed to support multi-tenancy, survey management, and response collection while maintaining data isolation between organizations.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The following diagram shows the core entities and their relationships in the Formbricks database:

## Core Models

### Organization & Project Management

1. **Organization**

   - Top-level entity for multi-tenancy
   - Contains multiple projects and team members
   - Manages billing and whitelabel settings

2. **Project**

   - Groups related surveys and configurations
   - Has two environments (production/development)
   - Controls branding and display settings

3. **Environment**
   - Isolates production and development resources
   - Contains surveys, contacts, and actions
   - Manages API keys and integrations

### Survey Management

1. **Survey**

   - Central model for questionnaires
   - Configurable with multiple questions and display rules
   - Supports multiple languages and targeting filters

2. **Response**

   - Records user answers to surveys
   - Links to contact information when available
   - Supports tagging and notes for analysis

3. **ActionClass**
   - Defines triggering points for surveys
   - Can be code-based or no-code configurations
   - Links surveys to specific user actions

### User Management

1. **User**

   - Represents system users (admins/team members)
   - Manages authentication and preferences
   - Can belong to multiple organizations

2. **Contact**

   - Represents survey respondents
   - Stores attributes for targeting
   - Tracks survey displays and responses

3. **Team**
   - Groups users within organizations
   - Controls project access permissions
   - Facilitates collaborative survey management

## Data Isolation

The database schema ensures proper data isolation through:

1. **Organization-level isolation**

   - Each organization has its own projects
   - Users can belong to multiple organizations
   - Resources are scoped to organizations

2. **Environment-level isolation**

   - Separate production and development environments
   - Independent surveys, contacts, and actions
   - Isolated API keys and integrations

3. **Project-level isolation**
   - Project-specific configurations
   - Separate language settings
   - Team-based access control

## Schema Management

The database schema is managed through Prisma, which provides:

- Type-safe database client
- Automatic migration generation
- Schema versioning
- Data validation
- Query optimization

For detailed information about specific models and their properties, refer to the [schema.prisma](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/database/schema.prisma) file in the repository.

## PostgreSQL Database Tables

Formbricks stores all data in PostgreSQL tables. Here's a comprehensive list of all database tables and their purposes:
