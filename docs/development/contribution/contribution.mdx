#### Talk to Us First

We highly recommend engaging with us on [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/discussions) before submitting contributions.
This helps improve the chances of your PR being accepted while avoiding unnecessary work.

#### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To keep Formbricks sustainable, we require a **CLA** from all contributors.

Once you open a PR, our **CLA bot** will prompt you to sign the agreement. We can only merge contributions after the CLA is signed.

#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

You can set up your environment using:

- [**Gitpod**](/development/local-setup/gitpod)

- [**GitHub Codespaces**](/development/local-setup/github-codespaces)

- [**Local Machine Setup**](/development/local-setup)

For junior developers, **Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces** are recommended as they allow you to start coding in minutes.
