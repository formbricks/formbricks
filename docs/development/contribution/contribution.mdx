We’re excited that you want to contribute to Formbricks! There are many ways to help, including reporting issues, fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation.

#### How to Contribute

- **Issues:** Found a bug? Facing deployment problems? Have user feedback? Report an issue for the fastest response.

- **Feature Requests:** Have an idea? Open an issue, tag it as an **Enhancement**, and clearly describe the issue you're solving.

- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR.

  - For small fixes with 1-5 lines of code changes, go ahead!

  - For bigger changes, we currently don't have the capacity to facilitate them.

#### Talk to Us First

We highly recommend engaging with us on [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/discussions) before submitting contributions.
This helps improve the chances of your PR being accepted while avoiding unnecessary work.

#### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To keep Formbricks sustainable, we require a **CLA** from all contributors.

Once you open a PR, our **CLA bot** will prompt you to sign the agreement. We can only merge contributions after the CLA is signed.

#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

You can set up your environment using:

- [**Gitpod**](/development/local-setup/gitpod)

- [**GitHub Codespaces**](/development/local-setup/github-codespaces)

- [**Local Machine Setup**](/development/local-setup)

For junior developers, **Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces** are recommended as they allow you to start coding in minutes.
