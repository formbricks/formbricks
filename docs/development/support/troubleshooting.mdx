## "The app doesn't work after Prisma migration"

If the app doesn’t work after a Prisma migration, clear your browser’s storage and reload the page. This will force the app to fetch data from the server again. ![prisma](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738108186/image_dwm9hp.jpg)

## "I ran 'pnpm i' but there seems to be an error with the packages"

If you run `pnpm i` and get an error with the packages, try running `pnpm clean` followed by `pnpm i` again. This often solves the problem.

## "I get a full-screen error with cryptic strings"

This usually happens when the Formbricks Widget isn't correctly or completely built.

```bash
pnpm build --filter=@formbricks/js

// Run the app again
pnpm dev
```

## "My machine struggles with the repository"

Since we're working with a monorepo structure, the repository can get quite big. If you're having trouble working with the repository, try the following:

```bash helloWorld.js
pnpm dev --filter=@formbricks/web...
```

It’s better to use a single terminal with `pnpm dev` rather than having multiple open (one with the Formbricks app and one with the demo).

## Error: "Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token !DOCTYPE ... is not valid JSON"![Syntax Error](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738109837/image_wbxv8k.jpg)

If you see this error, it happens when the person connected to the widget is deleted. To fix it, log out of the test person and reload the page.![Reset person](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwdb9tvii/image/upload/v1738110212/image_nvkpku.jpg)
