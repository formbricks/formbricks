## Initial Checks via GitHub Workflows

When a Pull Request (PR) is opened, our automated GitHub workflows perform several critical checks:

> **Note:** At Formbricks, all feature changes must be submitted through Pull Requests - direct pushes to protected branches are not allowed.

- **PR Title Validation**: Ensures clear, descriptive titles following our conventions
- **Build Verification**: Confirms that the build process completes successfully
- **Test Suite**: Runs all automated tests to catch potential regressions
- **Translation Check**: Identifies any missing translation keys
- **Linting**: Enforces our coding standards and style guidelines

These checks must pass before proceeding to manual review.

## Reviewer Assignment

Once all automated checks pass successfully:

- A team member with relevant expertise is assigned as the reviewer
- The reviewer is notified automatically through GitHub
- Priority is given based on PR urgency and complexity

## Functional Testing and UI Review

The assigned reviewer performs thorough testing:

### Functionality Testing

- Verifies that new features work as specified
- Tests edge cases and error scenarios
- Ensures proper error handling
- Checks integration with existing features

### UI Review (if applicable)

- Validates visual consistency
- Checks responsive behavior
- Ensures accessibility standards
- Reviews user interaction flows

## Feedback Process

If improvements are needed:

- Reviewers add inline comments on GitHub
- Feedback is specific and actionable
- Code suggestions are provided when helpful
- Comments follow our constructive feedback guidelines

## In-depth Code Review

Our code review process utilizes both human expertise and AI assistance:

### Manual Review

- Code structure and organization
- Design patterns and best practices
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Documentation completeness

### AI-Assisted Review

We leverage advanced AI tools for additional insights:

- **Code Rabbit**: Automated code analysis and suggestions
- **Sonarqube**: Code quality metrics and potential issues

## Resolution and Merge

Final steps before merging:

- All review comments must be addressed
- Required changes are implemented
- At least one reviewer approval is required
- All conversations must be resolved
- CI/CD pipeline passes again
- PR is merged into the target branch

## Best Practices

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Respond to review comments promptly
- Use the "Request Changes" feature when necessary
- Mark conversations as resolved when addressed
- Use approve/request changes workflow appropriately

## Conclusion

Our code review process combines automated checks, manual review, and AI assistance to ensure high-quality code contributions. This multi-layered approach helps maintain code quality while promoting knowledge sharing within the team.

Remember: Code reviews are not just about finding issuesâ€”they're opportunities for learning and improving our codebase together.
