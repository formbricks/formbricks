## Introduction

This document outlines the framework usage guidelines for Formbricks, which is built primarily on Next.js (with heavy use of Server-Side Rendering through the App Router), Tailwind CSS, and Prisma ORM. 

## Next.js

### App Router and Server Components

- Use the Next.js App Router with the /app directory for building the application.
- Leverage React Server Components, which are the default in the App Router.
- Perform server-side data fetching directly within page.tsx files using async function components.

### Data Fetching in page.tsx

- Implement data fetching logic directly in your page.tsx components. This allows for server-side rendering without needing separate data fetching methods like getServerSideProps.
- Utilize React Suspense and streaming features if using advanced asynchronous patterns.

### Server Actions for Mutations

- Define Server Actions in dedicated action.ts files.
- Server actions serve as entry points for mutations and delegate to service layers that perform Prisma operations and other business logic.
- This approach promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by keeping form actions and mutations decoupled from UI components.

### Error Handling and Performance

- Integrate error boundaries and loading states appropriately within your App Router structure.
- Optimize performance with Next.js built-in features such as dynamic imports, the Image component, and code splitting.

## Tailwind CSS
We follow the Tailwind framework as intended. Please have a look at the [Tailwind CSS Guidelines](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes) for more information.

## Prisma ORM
We're working with Prisma as our ORM. Please have a look at the [Prisma ORM Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm) for more information.
