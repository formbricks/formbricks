## Files and Directories

- Use lowercase and hyphen-separated names (kebab-case) for files and directories. For instance, use `user-profile.ts` instead of `UserProfile.ts`.
- Group related files in directories with descriptive names, using plural form where appropriate (e.g., `components`, `services`).
- Reserve clear, singular names for core modules (e.g., `app`, `server`).

## Code Symbols

### Variables and Functions

- Use camelCase for variables and function names (e.g., `fetchData`, `userList`).
- Choose descriptive names that identify the role or content, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations.

### Classes and Interfaces

- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and React components (e.g., `UserProfile`, `DataManager`).
- Prefix interfaces with `I` only if it adds clarity in your context, otherwise prefer clean names (e.g., `User` instead of `IUser`).

### Constants

- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `API_TIMEOUT`, `MAX_RETRIES`).

### CSS/Styling

- For component-specific stylesheets, follow the file naming of the component (e.g., `UserProfile.module.css` for `UserProfile` component).
- When using CSS frameworks like Tailwind, rely on utility classes; otherwise, use a consistent methodology (BEM, etc.) for custom styles.

## Testing

- Name test files with a clear extension such as `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, etc., and mirror the structure of the source code. For example, the test for `user-service.ts` should be `user-service.test.ts`.

## Special Cases

- For configuration files (e.g., `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`), follow the established naming provided by the framework unless a project-specific adjustment is necessary.
- Generated and build artifacts should follow the guidelines set out in the build process documentation.

## Consistency and Refactoring

- Regularly review and refactor names to stay aligned with project evolution. Consistent naming improves maintainability and onboarding of new team members.
- Automated linting and formatting tools (such as ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript and Prettier) can help enforce these conventions.

By adhering to these naming conventions, developers can ensure that the codebase remains understandable, maintainable, and scalable over time.
