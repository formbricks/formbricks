## Overview

At Formbricks, we maintain a robust testing strategy that ensures high-quality code and reliable functionality across all components. Our testing approach is comprehensive, covering multiple layers of the application through different types of tests.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Shift-Left Testing**: We integrate testing early in the development cycle
- **Test Automation**: Automated tests are integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- **Modular & Isolated Tests**: Each test focuses on a specific unit of functionality
- **Documentation & Maintainability**: Tests are self-documenting and maintained alongside source code

## Testing Structure

### 1. Unit Testing with Vitest

We use Vitest as our primary unit testing framework. Unit tests can be found:

- Co-located with source files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)
- Within `__tests__` directories
- Testing isolated components, functions, and modules

Key areas covered:

- Business logic validation
- Utility function behavior
- Component state management
- Error handling scenarios
- Data transformations

### 2. End-to-End Testing with Playwright

E2E tests are located in `apps/web/playwright/` and cover:

- Complete user workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Integration with external services
- User interface interactions
- Form submissions and validations

## Testing Practices

### Test Organization

- Tests are co-located with source code when possible
- Shared test utilities in common directories
- Consistent naming conventions
- Well-structured test hierarchies

### Code Coverage

- Automated coverage reporting via V8 provider
- Coverage reports include:
  - Text summaries
  - HTML reports
  - LCOV reports
- Focus on meaningful coverage over percentages

### Quality Assurance Process

1. **Pre-commit Testing**

   - Linting checks
   - Type checking
   - Build checking

2. **Continuous Integration**

   - Automated test suite execution
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Feature Testing**
   - New features require corresponding tests
   - Both unit and integration tests
   - Edge case coverage

## Testing Tools and Libraries

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **vi**: Mocking and spying utilities

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**

   - Each test should be self-contained
   - Proper setup and teardown
   - No shared state between tests

2. **Meaningful Assertions**

   - Clear test descriptions
   - Specific assertions
   - Comprehensive error messages

3. **Maintainable Tests**

   - DRY principles
   - Shared fixtures and helpers
   - Clear documentation

4. **Performance**
   - Fast execution
   - Efficient setup/teardown
   - Parallelization where possible

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of testing strategies
- Updates to testing documentation
- Integration of new testing tools and methods
- Team training and knowledge sharing
