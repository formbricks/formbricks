# n8n-nodes-starter

This repo contains example nodes to help you get started building your own custom integrations for [n8n](n8n.io). It includes the node linter and other dependencies.

To make your custom node available to the community, you must create it as an npm package, and [submit it to the npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 16. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).
* Install n8n with:
	```
	npm install n8n -g
	```
* Recommended: follow n8n's guide to [set up your development environment](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/node-development-environment/).


## Using this starter

These are the basic steps for working with the starter. For detailed guidance on creating and publishing nodes, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/).

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from this template repository.
2. Clone your new repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your organization>/<your-repo-name>.git
    ```
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
4. Open the project in your editor.
5. Browse the examples in `/nodes` and `/credentials`. Modify the examples, or replace them with your own nodes.
6. Update the `package.json` to match your details.
7. Run `npm run lint` to check for errors or `npm run lintfix` to automatically fix errors when possible.
8. Test your node locally. Refer to [Run your node locally](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/) for guidance.
9. Replace this README with documentation for your node. Use the [README_TEMPLATE](README_TEMPLATE.md) to get started.
10. Update the LICENSE file to use your details.
