## What is Formbricks

Formbricks is your go-to solution for in-product micro-surveys that will supercharge your product experience! ðŸš€ For more information please check out [formbricks.com](https://formbricks.com).

## How to use this library

1. Install the Formbricks package inside your project using npm:

```bash
npm install @formbricks/react-native
```

1. Import Formbricks and initialize the widget in your main component (e.g., App.tsx or App.js):

```javascript
import Formbricks, { track } from "@formbricks/react-native";

export default function App() {
  const config = {
    environmentId: "your-environment-id",
    apiHost: "https://app.formbricks.com",
    userId: "hello-user",
    attributes: {
      plan: "free",
    },
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Your app code */}
      <Formbricks initConfig={config} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Replace your-environment-id with your actual environment ID. You can find your environment ID in the **Connections instructions** in the Formbricks **Configuration** pages. Please make sure to pass a unique user identifier as `userId` to the Formbricks SDK (e.g. database id, email address).
