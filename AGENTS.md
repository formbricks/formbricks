# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Formbricks runs as a pnpm/turbo monorepo. `apps/web` is the Next.js product surface, with feature modules under `app/` and `modules/`, assets in `public/` and `images/`, and Playwright specs in `apps/web/playwright/`. `apps/storybook` renders reusable UI pieces for review. Shared logic lives in `packages/*`: `database` (Prisma schemas/migrations), `surveys`, `js-core`, `types`, plus linting and TypeScript presets (`config-*`). Deployment collateral is kept in `docs/`, `docker/`, and `helm-chart/`. Unit tests sit next to their source as `*.test.ts` or inside `__tests__`.

## Build, Test & Development Commands

- `pnpm install` — install workspace dependencies pinned by `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- `pnpm db:up` / `pnpm db:down` — start/stop the Docker services backing the app.
- `pnpm dev` — run all app and worker dev servers in parallel via Turborepo.
- `pnpm build` — generate production builds for every package and app.
- `pnpm lint` — apply the shared ESLint rules across the workspace.
- `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:coverage` — execute Vitest suites with optional coverage.
- `pnpm test:e2e` — launch the Playwright browser regression suite.
- `pnpm db:migrate:dev` — apply Prisma migrations against the dev database.

### Survey Packages Build & Cache

The `@formbricks/surveys` package is pre-compiled (Vite → UMD + ESM) and the built bundle is copied to `apps/web/public/js/`. The Next.js app imports from `dist/`, **not** the source files. This means:

- After any change to `packages/surveys` or its dependencies (`packages/survey-ui`, `packages/types`, etc.), you **must rebuild** for changes to take effect in the running app.
- Turborepo caches build outputs aggressively. Always use `--force` to bypass the cache when iterating on survey packages:
  ```
  rm -rf packages/surveys/dist apps/web/public/js/surveys.* node_modules/.cache/turbo
  pnpm build --filter=@formbricks/surveys... --force
  ```
- The browser also caches the UMD bundle (`surveys.umd.cjs`) served from `public/js/`. After rebuilding, do a **hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R) or disable the browser cache via DevTools to pick up the new bundle.
- If changes still don't appear, restart the Next.js dev server (`pnpm dev`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

TypeScript, React, and Prisma are the primary languages. Use the shared ESLint presets (`@formbricks/eslint-config`) and Prettier preset (110-char width, semicolons, double quotes, sorted import groups). Two-space indentation is standard; prefer `PascalCase` for React components and folders under `modules/`, `camelCase` for functions/variables, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` only for constants. When adding mocks, place them inside `__mocks__` so import ordering stays stable.
We are using SonarQube to identify code smells and security hotspots.
Always mark React component props as `Readonly<>` (e.g., `({ children }: Readonly<MyProps>)`).

## Architecture & Patterns

- Next.js app router lives in `apps/web/app` with route groups like `(app)` and `(auth)`. Services live in `apps/web/lib`, feature modules in `apps/web/modules`.
- Server actions wrap service calls and return `{ data }` or `{ error }` consistently.
- Context providers should guard against missing provider usage and use cleanup patterns that snapshot refs inside `useEffect` to avoid React hooks warnings

## Caching

- Use React `cache()` for request-level dedupe and `cache.withCache()` or explicit Redis for expensive data.
- Do not use Next.js `unstable_cache()`.
- Always use `createCacheKey.*` utilities for cache keys.

## i18n (Internationalization)

- All user-facing text must use the `t()` function from `react-i18next`.
- Key naming: use lowercase with dots for nesting (e.g., `common.welcome`).
- Translations are in `apps/web/locales/`. `en-US.json` is the source of truth.
- **Only ever add or edit strings in `en-US.json`.** Never hand-write, translate, or edit the other (non-English) locale files yourself — those are machine-generated from en-US by Lingo.dev.
- After adding or changing an en-US string, run `pnpm i18n` to generate the translations for every other locale and validate keys. Lingo.dev also auto-translates from en-US on commit.

## Date and Time Rendering

- All user-facing dates and times must use shared formatting helpers instead of ad hoc `date-fns`, `Intl`, or `toLocale*` calls in components.
- Locale for display must come from the app language source of truth (`user.locale`, `getLocale()`, or `i18n.resolvedLanguage`), not browser defaults or implicit `undefined` locale behavior.
- Locale and time zone are different concerns: locale controls formatting, time zone controls the represented clock/calendar moment.
- Never infer a time zone from locale. If a product-level time zone source of truth exists, use it explicitly; otherwise preserve the existing semantic meaning of the stored value and avoid introducing browser-dependent conversions.
- Machine-facing values for storage, APIs, exports, integrations, and logs must remain stable and non-localized (`ISO 8601` / UTC where applicable).

## Database & Prisma Performance

- Multi-tenancy: All data must be scoped by Organization or Environment.
- Soft Deletion: Check for `isActive` or `deletedAt` fields; use proper filtering.
- Never use `skip`/`offset` with `prisma.response.count()`; only use `where`.
- Separate count and data queries and run in parallel (`Promise.all`).
- Prefer cursor pagination for large datasets.
- When filtering by `createdAt`, include indexed fields (e.g., `surveyId` + `createdAt`).

## Testing Guidelines

Principles:

- Confidence over coverage. Test behavior and outcomes; avoid brittle implementation-detail tests.

Do:

- E2E tests (Playwright): cover critical user flows and regression risks. Extend existing specs or add
  focused new ones in `apps/web/playwright`, keep tests small and well-named, use descriptive filenames
  such as `billing.spec.ts`, tag slow suites with `@slow`, and run the suite before opening a PR.
- Unit tests: cover stable, high-value logic in `.ts` files, such as validators, transformers,
  evaluators, calculations, and edge cases. Keep assertions on inputs and outputs, colocate specs with
  the code they exercise (`utility.test.ts`), and mock network and storage boundaries through helpers
  from `@formbricks/*`.
- Manual QA, especially for releases: verify on staging and file bugs. If a bug is critical, backport and
  re-test.
- Run `pnpm test` before opening a PR and `pnpm test:coverage` when touching critical flows.

Do not:

- Do not write component or UI unit tests for `.tsx` files; React components are covered by Playwright E2E
  tests instead.
- Do not add coverage-driven or low-signal tests.
- Do not write tests that lock implementation details, markup, snapshots, or create churn.
- Do not create mega or flaky E2E tests; avoid timing hacks and unstable dependencies.

Heuristic:

- User journey risk: E2E.
- Pure logic or edge cases: unit test.
- Release readiness: manual QA plus bug/backport loop.

## Documentation (apps/docs)

- Add frontmatter with `title`, `description`, and `icon` at the top of the MDX file.
- Do not start with an H1; use Camel Case headings (only capitalize the feature name).
- Use Mintlify components for steps and callouts.
- If Enterprise-only, add the Enterprise note block described in docs.

## Storybook

- Stories live in `stories.tsx` in the component folder and import from `"./index"`.
- Use `@storybook/react-vite` and organize argTypes into `Behavior`, `Appearance`, `Content`.
- Include Default, Disabled (if supported), WithIcon (if supported), all variants, and edge cases.

## GitHub Actions

- Always set minimal `permissions` for `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- On `ubuntu-latest`, add `step-security/harden-runner` as the first step.

## Quality Checklist

- Keep code DRY and small; remove dead code and unused imports.
- Follow React hooks rules, keep effects focused, and avoid unnecessary `useMemo`/`useCallback`.
- Prefer type inference, avoid `any`, and use shared types from `@formbricks/types`.
- Keep components focused, avoid deep nesting, and ensure basic accessibility.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commits follow a lightweight Conventional Commit format (`fix:`, `chore:`, `feat:`) and usually append the PR number, e.g. `fix: update OpenAPI schema (#6617)`. Keep commits scoped and lint-clean. Pull requests should outline the problem, summarize the solution, and link to issues or product specs. Attach screenshots or gifs for UI-facing work, list any migrations or env changes, and paste the output of relevant commands (`pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm db:migrate:dev`) so reviewers can verify readiness.

## Next.js Documentation

Do not rely on training data for Next.js behavior in this repo. For any Next.js-related work (routing, layouts, server/client components, caching, next.config, etc.), use the `nextjs-docs` skill, which indexes the version-pinned local docs in `.next-docs/`.

<!-- robots:start (managed by .agents/install.sh - do not edit inside this block) -->
## Agent setup (robots)

Shared agent skills and subagents are installed under `.claude/`, and design context under `.agents/` (symlinked from the robots clone; `git -C <clone> pull` refreshes every install). This complements the conventions above; it does not replace them.

- If `.agents/formbricks-context/DESIGN.md` exists, read it before building or reviewing UI for this repo: it indexes the per-surface design guides (tokens, components, motion, the quality bar).
- Skills and subagents live in `.claude/`. Treat the design context above as part of these instructions.
