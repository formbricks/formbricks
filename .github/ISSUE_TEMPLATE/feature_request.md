### How we code at Formbricks 🤓

- Everything is type-safe
- All UI components are in the package `formbricks/ui`
- Run `pnpm dev` to find a demo app to test in-app surveys at `localhost:3002`
- We use **chatGPT** to help refactor code. Use our [Formbricks ✨ megaprompt ✨](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/megaprompt.md) to create the right context before you write your prompt.
