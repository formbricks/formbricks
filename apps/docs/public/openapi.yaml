    Formbricks offers two types of APIs: the **Public Client API** and the
    **Management API**. Each API serves a different purpose, has different
    authentication requirements, and provides access to different data and
    settings.


    Checkout the [API Key
    Setup](https://formbricks.com/docs/api/management/api-key-setup) - to access
    the Management APIs wit an API Key.


    > If you have forked the collection & running it, we recommend you to
    atleast update `apiKey` & `environmentId` the Collection variables as per
    your values! We also have a lot of post-run scripts written to help you
    navigate through auto-assigning variables when running scripts.

    description: >-
      The Public Client API is designed for the JavaScript SDK and does not
      require authentication. It's primarily used for creating persons,
      sessions, and responses within the Formbricks platform. This API is ideal
      for client-side interactions, as it doesn't expose sensitive information.

      API](https://go.postman.co/workspace/90ba379a-0de2-47d2-a94c-8eb541e47082/documentation/11026000-927c954f-85a9-4f8f-b0ec-14191b903737?entity=folder-b8f3a10e-1642-4d82-a629-fef0a8c6c86c)
      - Create actions for a person

      - [Displays API](https://formbricks.com/docs/api/client/displays) - Mark
      Survey as Displayed or Responded for a Person

      - [People API](https://formbricks.com/docs/api/client/people) - Create &
      update people (e.g. attributes)

      - [Responses API](https://formbricks.com/docs/api/client/responses) -
      Create & update responses for a survey
  - name: Client API > Display
    description: >-
      Displays are metrics used to measure the number of times a survey was
      viewed both by unidentified or identified users.
  - name: Client API > People
    description: >-
      Persons are the identified users on Formbricks app that get initated when
      you pass a userId and have user activation enabled. This now allows you to
      track & show them targeted surveys based on their actions, attributes,
      etc.
  - name: Client API > Response
    description: >-
      Responses are captured whenever a user fills in your survey either
      partially or completely.
  - name: Management API
    description: "The Management API provides access to all data and settings that are visible in the Formbricks App. This API requires a personal API Key for authentication, which can be generated in the Settings section of the Formbricks App. With the Management API, you can manage your Formbricks account programmatically, accessing and modifying data and settings as needed.\n\n> **For Auth:**\_we use the `x-api-key` header \n  \n\nAPI requests made to the Management API are authorized using a personal API key. This key grants the same rights and access as if you were logged in at formbricks.com. It's essential to keep your API key secure and not share it with others.\n\nTo generate, store, or delete an API key, follow the instructions provided on the following page\_[API Key](https://formbricks.com/docs/api/management/api-key-setup)."
  - name: Management API > Action Class
    description: >-
      Action Classes allow you to set behaviour methods such as when a user
      clicks on a buy now button, or when a user leaves the page, etc. These
      allow you to trigger specific surveys to these users.


      Methods: Get All, Get, Create, Update, and Delete Action Classes
  - name: Management API > Attribute Class
    description: >-
      Attribute Classes help you categorize attributes so that you can target
      users based on specific values of their attributes. They are associated
      with a Person. Read more
      [here](https://formbricks.com/docs/in-app-surveys/attributes)
  - name: Management API > Contacts
    description: >-
      The Contacts API allows you to retrieve information about contacts in your environment.
      Contacts represent users who have interacted with your surveys or forms.
  - name: Management API > Contact Attributes
    description: >-
      The Contact Attributes API allows you to retrieve information about attributes
      associated with contacts in your environment. These attributes can include
      custom properties and values assigned to your contacts.
  - name: Management API > Contact Attribute Keys
    description: >-
      The Contact Attribute Keys API allows you to retrieve information about the defined
      attribute keys in your environment. These keys define the structure and properties
      that can be assigned to contacts, such as email, name, or custom attributes.

      utilise Formbricks User Identification to its maximum.


      Methods: Get All, Get, and Delete Persons
  - name: Management API > Response
    description: >-
      Responses are what your users fill in as answers to a survey. Use this
      cautiosly and make sure you handle this data carefully.


      Methods allowed: Get All, Get by Survey, Get, Update, and Delete Responses
  - name: Management API > Survey
    description: >-
      Surveys are the core of user data & feedback collection. We have various
      types of surveys to cater to you:


      - In-App Surveys
          
      - Website Surveys
          
      - Link Surveys
          

      Create surveys & then trigger them as per your actions & attribute
      filterings that you have set to make the most of them.


      Methods allowed: Get All, Get, Create, Update, and Delete Surveys
  - name: Management API > Webhook
    description: >-
      Formbricks' Webhook API offers a powerful interface for interacting with
      webhooks. Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications of
      changes to specific objects in the Formbricks environment.


      The behavior of the webhooks is determined by their trigger settings. The
      trigger determines which updates the webhook sends. Current available
      triggers include:


      - "responseCreated"
          
      - "responseUpdated", and
          
      - "responseFinished".
          

      These APIs are designed to facilitate seamless integration of Formbricks
      with third-party systems. By making use of our webhook API, you can
      automate the process of sending data to these systems whenever significant
      events occur within your Formbricks environment.
