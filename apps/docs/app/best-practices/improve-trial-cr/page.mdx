#### Best Practices

# Improve Trial Conversion

When a user doesn't convert, you want to know why. A micro-survey displayed at exactly the right time gives you a window into understanding the most relevant question: To pay or not to pay?

## Purpose

The better you understand why free users don’t convert to paid users, the higher your revenue. You can make an informed decision about what to change in your offering to make more people pay for your service.

## Formbricks Approach

- Ask at exactly the right point in time
- Ask to understand the problem, don’t ask for solutions

## Installation

To display the Trial Conversion Survey in your app you want to proceed as follows:

1. Create new Trial Conversion Survey at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/)
2. Set up the user action to display survey at right point in time
3. Print that 💸

<Note>
  ## Formbricks Widget running? We assume that you have already installed the Formbricks Widget in your web app. It’s required to display messages and surveys in your app. If not, please follow the [Quick Start Guide (takes 15mins max.)](/app-surveys/quickstart)
</Note>

### 1. Create new Trial Conversion Survey

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Click on "Create Survey" and choose the template “Improve Trial Conversion”:

<MdxImage
  src={CreateSurvey}
  alt="Create survey by template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 2. Update questions (if you like)

You’re free to update the questions and answer options. However, based on our experience, we suggest giving the provided template a go 😊

<MdxImage
  src={ChangeText}
  alt="Change text content"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

_Want to change the button color? You can do so in the project settings!_

Save, and move over to the “Audience” tab.

### 3. Pre-segment your audience (coming soon)

<Note>
  ## Filter by attribute coming soon We're working on pre-segmenting users by attributes. We will update this
  manual in the next days.
</Note>

Pre-segmentation isn't relevant for this survey because you likely want to solve all people who cancel their trial. You probably have a specific user action e.g. clicking on "Cancel Trial" you can use to only display the survey to users trialing your product.

### 4. Set up a trigger for the Trial Conversion Survey:

How you trigger your survey depends on your product. There are two options:

1. **Trigger by Page view:** Let’s say you have a page under “/trial-cancelled” where you forward users once they cancelled the trial subscription. You can then create an user Action with the type `Page View` and add select `Limit to specific pages` to add url filters, with the following settings:

<MdxImage
  src={ActionPageurl}
  alt="Change text content"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Whenever a user visits this page, the survey will be displayed ✅

2. **Trigger by Button Click:** In a different case, you have a “Cancel Trial" button in your app. You can setup a user Action with the according `Inner Text` like so:

<MdxImage
  src={ActionText}
  alt="Change text content"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Please have a look at our complete [Actions manual](/app-surveys/actions/) if you have questions.

### 5. Select Action in the “When to ask” card

<MdxImage
  src={SelectAction}
  alt="Select feedback button action"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 6. Last step: Set Recontact Options correctly

Lastly, scroll down to “Recontact Options”. Here you have to choose the correct settings to make sure you gather as many insights as possible. You want to make sure that this survey is always displayed, no matter if the user has already seen a survey in the past days:

<MdxImage
  src={RecontactOptions}
  alt="Set recontact options"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 7. Congrats! You’re ready to publish your survey 💃

<MdxImage src={Publish} alt="Publish survey" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

<Note>
  ## Formbricks Widget running? You need to have the Formbricks Widget installed to display the Feedback Box
  in your app. Please follow [this tutorial (Step 4 onwards)](/app-surveys/quickstart) to install the widget.
