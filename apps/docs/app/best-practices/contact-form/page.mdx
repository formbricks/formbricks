# Creating a Contact Form with Formbricks: A Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on creating a contact form using Formbricks. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned developer, this tutorial will walk you through every step of building an engaging and effective contact form.

## What We’ll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a simple contact form featuring:
1. A welcoming introduction.
2. Fields for collecting the user's name and email.
3. A question to find out why they’re contacting you.
4. A message field for users to share their queries.

### Setting Up Your Form

First, let's lay the groundwork for your form:

1. Head to the Surveys page and click on **New Survey**.
2. Select **Start from Scratch** to create a new form.
3. In the form editor, click the three dots next to a question, then select **Change Question Type** and choose **Statement (Call to Action)**.

/>

4. Add a welcoming statement to greet your users and explain the form's purpose.
5. Personalize the greeting to make it inviting and encourage engagement.

<Note>
  A warm welcome sets the tone for your form. Make it friendly to encourage users to participate. 
</Note>

### Adding the Name Field

Next, let's capture the user's name:

1. Click **Add Question**.
   <MdxImage
     src={AddQuestion}
     alt="Adding a question in Formbricks"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />
2. Enter the prompts for the name field.
3. Turn off the **Long Answer** option at the bottom right.
4. Adjust any **settings**, such as making the field required.

  src={NameField}

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### Adding the Email Field

Now, let’s add a field to collect the user's email address:

1. Click **Add Question** again.
2. Select Email as the input type.
3. Enter a prompt for the email field.

<MdxImage
  src={EmailField}
  alt="Email field configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### Adding a Reason for Contact

Let’s now understand why the user is contacting you:

1. Click **Add Question** once again.
2. Select **Change Question** Type and choose **Single Select**.
3. Add the question "Why are you contacting us today?"

<MdxImage
  src={SingleSelect}
  alt="Single Select question configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>Predefined options help categorize inquiries, making it easier for you to respond appropriately.</Note>

4. Add options like "General Inquiry," "Support," and "Feedback."

<MdxImage
  src={QueryImage}
  alt="Single Select question configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### Adding a Message Field

Finally, let’s provide a space for the user’s message:

1. Click **Add Question** for the last time.
2. Add the question: "Your Message."
3. Set the placeholder text to something like "Please write your message here."

<MdxImage
  src={MessageField}
  alt="Message field configuration"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. Consider setting a minimum character count to ensure detailed messages.

### Finalizing Your Form

Once your form is complete, follow these final steps:

1. Review and rearrange the questions if necessary.
2. Test the form by filling it out as a user.
3. Customize the **Thank You** message for submissions.
4. Publish the form to get a shareable link.
5. Enable submission notifications:
   - Go to your Formbricks account settings.
   - Verify your email address.
   - Ensure that **Survey** notifications are enabled.

### Integrating the Contact Form into Your Website

After publishing the form, follow these steps to integrate it into your site:

1. **Copy the Shareable Link**  
   - Find your form in the Formbricks dashboard, and click Share.
   - Select Embed in a Web Page.

   <MdxImage
     src={EmbedImage}
     alt="Embed Image configuration"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

2. **Embed the Code**  
   - Copy the provided code and paste it into your website where you want the form to appear.

<Note>Note: There is an options toggle button called "Embed Mode." When enabled, it updates the `src` to `"?embed=true"` and displays your survey in a minimalist design, removing padding and background for a cleaner look.</Note>

3. **Test the Integration**  
   - Check if the form displays correctly on your site.
   - Submit a test entry to ensure everything works and notifications are received.
