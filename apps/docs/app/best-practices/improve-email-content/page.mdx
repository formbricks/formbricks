#### Best Practices

# Improve Email Content

Email remains the predominant way to communicate with your customers. Measure the effectiveness to improve your offering.

## Purpose

Measuring the content quality of both transactional and marketing email is a key element for improving customer communication.

## Formbricks Approach

- Embed the survey into your email so it‚Äôs part of the newsletter.
- Use link prefilling to store the answer users clicked on in the email.
- Dynamic user identification to append reader's email for personalized profiles and follow ups.

## Installation

To embed the newsletter survey into your email, follow these steps:

1. Create new 'Improve Newsletter Content' survey at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/)
2. Select how you where you want to display the survey.
3. Copy the embed code anywhere you want in your newsletter.

### 1. Create new 'Improve Newsletter Content' Survey

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Then, create a new survey and look for the "Improve Newsletter Content" template:

<MdxImage
  src={NewsletterSurvey}
  alt="Create Improve Newsletter Content by template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 2. Customize Survey questions

Customize survey questions, emojis or stars however you like:

<MdxImage
  src={NewsletterSurveyEditor}
  alt="Edit Improve Newsletter Content template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 3. Configure Survey Settings

When you are done customizing your survey questions, navigate to the Settings tab and choose the type of survey you want. You need to choose Link Survey:

<MdxImage
  src={NewsletterSurveyType}
  alt="Choose survey type"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 4. Choose how you want to embed your survey

After publishing your survey, a modal that prompts you to embed your survey will pop up.

<MdxImage
  src={NewsletterSurveyEmbedPrompt}
  alt="Embed newsletter survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Select the Embed Survey card and you will be directed to another modal, where the first embed option displayed will be to embed the survey in an email.

### 5. Copy code to embed the survey in your newsletter

Click the button with the ‚ÄúView Embed Code‚Äù text at the top right corner of the modal and simply paste the HTML code for your survey anywhere you want it in your newsletter. You can see the preview in the below image:

<MdxImage
  src={NewsletterSurveyEmbedCode}
  alt="Embed survey code"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
