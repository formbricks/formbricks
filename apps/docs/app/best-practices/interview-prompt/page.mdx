#### Best Practices

# App Interview Prompt

The Interview Prompt allows you to pick a specific user segment (e.g. Power Users) and invite them to a user interview. Bye, bye spammy email invites, benefit from up to 6x more respondents.

## Purpose

Product analytics and app surveys are incomplete without user interviews. Set the scheduling on autopilot for a continuous stream of interviews.

## Formbricks Approach

- Pre-segment users with custom attributes. Only invite highly relevant users.
- In-app prompts (app surveys or website surveys) have a 6x higher conversion rate than email invites.
- Set scheduling user interviews on auto pilot.
- Soon: Integrate directly with your [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) account.

## Installation

To display an Interview Prompt in your app you want to proceed as follows:

1. Create new Interview Prompt at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/)
2. Adjust content and settings
3. That’s it! 🎉

<Note>
  ## Formbricks Widget running? 
  We assume that you have already installed the Formbricks Widget in your web app. It’s required to display messages and surveys in your app. If not, please follow the [Quick Start Guide (15mins).](/app-surveys/quickstart)
</Note>

### 1. Create new Interview Prompt

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Click on "Create Survey" and choose the template “Interview Prompt”:

<MdxImage
  src={CreatePrompt}
  alt="Create interview prompt by template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 2. Update prompt and CTA

Update the prompt, description and button text to match your products tonality. You can also update the button color in the Product Settings.

<MdxImage
  src={ChangeText}
  alt="Change text content"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In the button settings you have to make sure it is set to “External URL”. In the URL field, copy your booking link (e.g. https://cal.com/company/user-interview). If you don’t have a booking link yet, head over to [cal.com](http://cal.com) and get one - they have the best free plan out there!

<MdxImage
  src={InterviewExample}
  alt="Add CSS action"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Save, and move over to the “Audience” tab.

### 3. Pre-segment your audience (coming soon)

<Note>
  ## Filter by attribute coming soon. We're working on pre-segmenting users by attributes. We will update this manual in the next few days.
</Note>

Once you clicked over to the “Audience” tab you can change the settings. In the **Who To Send** card, select “Filter audience by attribute”. This allows you to only show the prompt to a specific segment of your user base.

In our case, we want to select users who we have assigned the attribute “Power User”. To learn how to assign attributes to your users, please [follow this guide](/app-surveys/user-identification).

Great, now only the “Power User” segment will see our Interview Prompt. But when will they see it?

### 4. Set up a trigger for the Interview Prompt:

To create the trigger to show your Interview Prompt, go to the “Audience” tab, find the “When to send” card and choose “Add Action”. We will now use our super cool User Action Tracker:

<MdxImage src={AddAction} alt="Add action" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

Generally, we have two types of user actions: Page views and clicks. The Interview Prompt, you’ll likely want to display it on a page visit since you already filter who sees the prompt by attributes.

1. **Page view:** Whenever a user visits a page the survey will be displayed, as long as the other conditions match. Other conditions are pre-segmentation, if this user has seen a survey in the past 2 weeks, etc.

<MdxImage
  src={ActionPageurl}
  alt="Add page URL action"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. **Click(Inner Text & CSS Selector):** When a user clicks an element (like a button) with a specific text content or CSS selector, the prompt will be displayed as long as the other conditions also match.

<div className="grid max-w-full grid-cols-2 space-x-2 sm:max-w-3xl">
  <MdxImage src={ActionCSS} alt="Add CSS action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />
  <MdxImage src={ActionInner} alt="Add inner text action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />
</div>

### 5. Select action in the “When to ask” card

<MdxImage
  src={SelectAction}
  alt="Select feedback button action"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 6. Set Recontact Options correctly

Scroll down to “Recontact Options”. Here you have to choose the correct settings to strike the right balance between asking for user feedback and preventing survey fatigue. Your settings also depend on the size of your user base or segment. If you e.g. have thousands of “Power Users” you can easily afford to only display the prompt once. If you have a smaller user base you might want to ask twice to get a sufficient amount of bookings:

<MdxImage
  src={RecontactOptions}
  alt="Set recontact options"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 7. Congrats! You’re ready to publish your survey 💃 🤸

<MdxImage src={Publish} alt="Publish survey" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

<Note>
  ## Formbricks Widget running? You need to have the Formbricks Widget installed to display the Feedback Box in your app. Please follow [this tutorial (Step 4 onwards)](/app-surveys/quickstart) to install the widget.
