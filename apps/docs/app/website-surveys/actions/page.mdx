#### Website Surveys

# Actions

Actions are triggers based on interactions with your website, allowing you to capture feedback precisely when it's most relevant.

<Note>
  These actions operate **independently** as website surveys do not involve user identification. If you have
  user identification enabled (you’ve initialized Formbricks with a userId), please refer to the App Surveys
  Action Guide.
</Note>

## **How Do Actions Work?**

Actions are predefined events within your website that prompt Formbricks to display a survey when triggered. These are detected by the Formbricks widget, which then presents the appropriate survey based on your predefined settings.

## **Why Are Actions Useful?**

Actions enable surveys to be displayed based on specific site interactions or behaviours, independent of user identity. This approach is perfect for:

- **Public-Facing Websites**: Engage visitors on general content pages where user authentication is not present.
- **Anonymous User Interactions**: Capture feedback without needing to identify or track individual users, maintaining user privacy and simplicity in data collection.

Using actions to trigger surveys enhances the relevance of survey content to the visitor's current interaction, potentially increasing engagement and the accuracy of feedback.

## **Setting Up No-Code Actions**

Formbricks provides an intuitive No-Code interface for configuring actions, enabling surveys to be triggered by various interactions on your website. To add a No-Code Action:

1. Visit the Formbricks Dashboard & switch to the Actions tab:

   <MdxImage
     src={StepOne}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

2. Now click on “Add Action”

   <MdxImage
     src={StepTwo}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

Here are four types of No-Code actions you can set up:

### **1. Click Action**

Click Action is triggered when a user clicks on a specific element within your application. You can define the element's inner text or CSS selector to trigger the survey.

- **Inner Text**: Checks if the innerText of a clicked HTML element, like a button label, matches a specific text. This action allows you to display a survey based on text interactions within your application.

- **CSS Selector**: Verifies if a clicked HTML element matches a provided CSS selector, such as a class, ID, or any other CSS selector used in your website. It enables survey triggers based on element interactions.

### **2. Page view Action**

This action is triggered when a user visits a page within your application.

### **3. Exit Intent Action**

This action is triggered when a user is about to leave your application. It helps capture user feedback before they exit, providing valuable insights into user experiences and potential improvements.

### **4. 50% Scroll Action**

This action is triggered when a user scrolls through 50% of a page within your application. It helps capture user feedback at a specific point in their journey, enabling you to gather insights based on user interactions.

This action is triggered when a user visits a specific page within your application. You can define the URL match conditions as follows:

<Note>
You can combine the url filters with any of the no-code actions to trigger the survey based on the URL match conditions.

### **URL Match Conditions**

- **exactMatch**: Triggers the action when the URL exactly matches the specified string.
- **contains**: Activates when the URL contains the specified substring.
- **startsWith**: Fires when the URL starts with the specified string.
- **endsWith**: Executes when the URL ends with the specified string.
- **notMatch**: Triggers when the URL does not match the specified condition.
- **notContains**: Activates when the URL does not contain the specified substring.

</Note>

## **Setting Up Code Actions**

For enhanced customization, actions can also be implemented directly through code:

1. **Configure the Action**: First, add the action via the Formbricks web interface to link it with the desired survey.
2. **Track an Action**: Use the **`formbricks.track()`** function to activate the survey from your website's frontend.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Example of tracking an action">

```jsx
formbricks.track("Action Name");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

**Example - Tracking a Button Click**:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Example: Button Click Action">

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  formbricks.track("Button Clicked");
};
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;

```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## **Conclusion**

Using generic actions to trigger surveys on your website provides a straightforward and effective method to engage visitors and gather feedback. This approach is especially valuable for public-facing websites and pages where user authentication barriers are absent, allowing for broad interaction and feedback collection without the complexities of user identification.
