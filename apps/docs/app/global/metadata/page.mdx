# User Metadata

Formbricks captures metadata of your users for you when they fill a survey.

This metadata is useful for understanding the context in which the user filled the survey. For example, if you are running a marketing campaign, you can understand which source is driving the most responses. Or if you are running a survey on a specific page, you can understand the user's behavior on that page.

## Metadata Captured

- **Source**: The source from where the user filled the survey. This could be an App, Link, or a Webpage.
- **URL**: The URL of the page where the user filled the survey.
- **Browser**: The browser used by the user to fill the survey.
- **OS**: The operating system of the device used by the user to fill the survey.
- **Device**: The device used by the user to fill the survey.
- **Country**: The country of the user.
- **Action**: The action that triggered the survey. This is only available for App surveys.

## View Response Metadata

1. Go to the Responses tab of your survey.
2. Hover over the profile icon of the user on the response card & you should see a tooltip opening up with the metadata details.

## Filter Responses by Metadata

1. Go to the Responses tab of your survey.
2. Click on the Filter button.
3. Scroll down & Select the metadata field you want to filter by.
4. Select the condition & the value you want to filter by.

<MdxImage

5. Now you should see the responses filtered based on the metadata you selected. If you want to see a walkthrough, view the video above to see how you can view & filter responses by metadata.

## Export Metadata
