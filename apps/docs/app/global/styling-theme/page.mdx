## Configuration

In the left side bar, you find the `Configuration` page. On this page you find the `Look & Feel` section:

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

/>

- **Hide Progress Bar**: Optionally remove the progress bar to simplify the survey experience
- **Add Highlight Border**: Adds a distinct border for emphasis.

3. **Background Styling**: Customize the survey background with static colors, animations, or images (upload your own or get from Unsplash)

<Note>This is only available for Link Surveys</Note>

<MdxImage
  src={BackgroundSettings}
  alt="Background styling options UI"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

- **Color**: Pick any color for the background

- **Background Overlay**: Adjust the background's opacity

## Add Brand Logo

Customize your survey with your brand's logo.

<Note>Brand logos are only visible on Link Survey pages.</Note>

1. In the Look & Feel page itself in Project settings, scroll down to see the Logo Upload box.

<MdxImage
  src={StepFour}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. Upload your logo

<MdxImage
  src={StepFive}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. Add a background color: If youâ€™ve uploaded a transparent image and want to add background to it, enable this toggle and select the color of your choice.

<MdxImage
  src={StepSix}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. Remember to save your changes!

<MdxImage
  src={StepSeven}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>The logo settings apply across all Link Surveys pages.</Note>

## Overwrite Styling Theme

You can allow to overwrite the styling theme for individual surveys to create unique styles for each survey:

<MdxImage
  src={AllowOverwrite}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In the survey editor, a tab called `Styling` will appear. Here you can overwrite the default styling theme.
