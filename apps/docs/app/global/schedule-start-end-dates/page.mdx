# Schedule Start & End Dates

Optimize your survey management with custom Start & End Conditions in Formbricks. This feature allows you to control exactly when your survey is available for responses and when it should close, making it ideal for time-sensitive or number-of-response-limited surveys.

Configure your surveys to open and close based on specific criteria. Here’s how to set up these conditions:

## **Schedule a Survey Release**

- **How to**: Open the Survey Editor, switch to the Settings tab. Scroll down to Response Options, Toggle the “Release Survey on Date”.

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

- **Details**: Choose the date and time when the survey should become available to respondents. All times follow UTC timezone.
- **Use Case**: This is useful for launching surveys in alignment with events, product releases, or specific marketing campaigns.

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>
- **Details**: Define a specific date and time for the survey to close. This also follows UTC timezone. - **Use
Case**: Essential for surveys linked to time-bound events or studies where data collection needs to end at a specific
point.
