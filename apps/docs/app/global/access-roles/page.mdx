## Inviting organization members

There are two ways to invite organization members: One by one or in bulk.

### Invite organization members one by one

1. Go to the `Organization Settings` page via the menu in the lower right corner:

<MdxImage
  src={MenuItem}
  alt="Where to find the Menu Item for Organization Settings"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. Click on the `Add member` button:

<MdxImage
  src={AddMember}
  alt="Add member Button Position"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. In the modal, add the Name, Email and Role of the organization member you want to invite:

<MdxImage
  src={IndvInvite}
  alt="Individual Invite Modal Tab"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>
  Access Roles is a feature of the **Enterprise Edition**. In the **Community Edition** and on the **Free**
  and **Startup** plan in the Cloud you can invite unlimited organization members as `Admins`.
</Note>

Formbricks sends an email to the organization member with an invitation link. The organization member can accept the invitation or create a new account by clicking on the link.

### Invite organization members in bulk

<MdxImage

  alt="Where to find the Menu Item for Organization Settings"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. Click on the `Add member` button:

<MdxImage
  src={AddMember}
  alt="Add member Button Position"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. In the modal, switch to `Bulk Invite`. You can download an example .CSV file to fill in the Name, Email and Role of the organization members you want to invite:

<MdxImage
  src={BulkInvite}
  alt="Individual Invite Modal Tab"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. Upload the filled .CSV file and invite the organization members in bulk ✅

Formbricks sends an email to each organization member in the CSV. The member can accept the invitation or create a new account by clicking on the link.
