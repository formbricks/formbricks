# Webhooks

Formbricks' Webhook API offers a powerful interface for interacting with webhooks. Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications of changes to specific objects in the Formbricks environment.

These APIs are designed to facilitate seamless integration of Formbricks with third-party systems. By making use of our webhook API, you can automate the process of sending data to these systems whenever significant events occur within your Formbricks environment.

### Leveraging Webhooks

The behavior of the webhooks is determined by their trigger settings. The trigger determines which updates the webhook sends. Current available triggers include:

- "responseCreated"
- "responseUpdated",
- "responseFinished".

### Creating Webhooks

There are 2 ways for you to create webhooks with Formbricks ie either via our App UI or through API.

**UI:**

1. Login to the Formbricks App & switch to the Integrations Tab

   <MdxImage src={StepOne} alt="Step One" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

2. Click on **Manage Webhooks** & then **Add Webhook** button:

   <MdxImage src={StepTwo} alt="Step Two" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

3. Add your webhook listener endpoint & test it to make sure it can receive the test endpoint otherwise you will not be able to save it.

   <MdxImage src={StepThree} alt="Step Three" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

4. Now add the triggers you want to listen to and the surveys!

   <MdxImage src={StepThree} alt="Step Four" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

That’s it! Your webhooks will not start receiving data as soon as it arrives!

    <MdxImage
     src={StepFive}
     alt="Step Five"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
    />

- API: Use our documented methods on Creation, List, & Deletion endpoints of the Webhook API mentioned in the [Postman Documenter](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#62e6ec65-021b-42a4-ac93-d1434b393c6c)
