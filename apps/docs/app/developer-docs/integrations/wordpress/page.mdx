# Connect Formbricks with your WordPress page

If you want to run a targeted survey on your WordPress website, Formbricks is the way to go! With our generous free plan and open source tech, you get everything you need to get started and keep full control over your data.

## TLDR

1. Install the Formbricks WordPress plugin
2. Create a [free Formbricks account](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)
3. Find and copy the `environment id`
4. Copy the environment id into the right field in the plugin settings
5. Create survey on trigger ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù to test it

## Step 1: Install the Formbricks WordPress plugin

As long as the Formbricks plugin is in review, please download it from our [GitHub repository directly.](https://github.com/formbricks/wordpress)

<MdxImage
  src={Img1}
  alt="Run targeted website survye on any WordPress site"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 2: Create a Formbricks Account

This is super straight forward: Go to [app.formbricks.com/auth/signup](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup), create the account, verify your email and you‚Äôre in!

When you see this screen, you‚Äôre there:

<MdxImage
  src={Img2}
  alt="Free HotJar survey alternative open source"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 3: Find and copy the environmentId

Go to Settings > Setup Checklist where you‚Äôll find your environmentId:

<MdxImage
  src={Img3}
  alt="Run targeted surveys for free on WordPress pages"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 4: Copy the environmentId to the WordPress Plugin Settings

In your WordPress instance, go to the Formbricks Plugin settings and copy the environmentId in the correct field:

<MdxImage
  src={Img5}
  alt="Free and open source HotJar survey on WordPress page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Then click the button at the bottom to see if the connection worked.

<Note>If you don‚Äôt use our Cloud, you also have to update the API Host</Note>

Great!

## Step 5: Create survey on trigger ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù

Now that all is setup, we create a survey to display an example survey. Pick any template here:

<MdxImage
  src={Img2}
  alt="Free HotJar survey alternative open source"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Keep the content for now, click on the Settings tab:

<MdxImage
  src={Img4}
  alt="Free and open source HotJar survey on WordPress page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Here we do three things:

1. Change survey type to **App Survey** or **Website Survey**(for public facing)
2. Select trigger ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù
3. Publish

<MdxImage
  src={Img6}
  alt="Open Source survey on targeted website wordpress"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

When you see this page, you did it!

<MdxImage
  src={Img7}
  alt="Run free an open source targeted survey on any page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 6: Reload your page to check out your survey ü§ì

You did it! Reload the WordPress page and your survey should appear!
