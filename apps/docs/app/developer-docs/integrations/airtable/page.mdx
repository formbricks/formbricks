#### Integrations

# Airtable

The Airtable integration allows you to automatically send responses to an Airtable of your choice.

<Note>
    If you are on a self-hosted instance, you will need to configure this integration separately. Please follow the guides [here](/self-hosting/integrations) to configure integrations on your self-hosted instance.
</Note>

## Formbricks Cloud

1. Go to the Integrations tab in your [Formbricks Cloud dashboard](https://app.formbricks.com/) and click on the "Connect" button under Airtable integration.

  alt="Formbricks Integrations Tab"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. Now click on the "Connect with Airtable" button to authenticate yourself with Airtable.

<MdxImage
  src={ConnectWithAirtable}
  alt="Connect Formbricks with Airtable"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. You will now be taken to a page where you need to add and grant access to the base you want to use for the integration.

<MdxImage
  src={ConnectWithAirtable}
  alt="Add and grant access to airtable base"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. Once you add and grant access to your base, you will be taken back to Formbricks Cloud and see the connected status as below:

<MdxImage
  src={AirtableConnected}
  alt="Formbricks is now connected with Google"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>

Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at least one question and a Airtable base with atleast one table in the Airtable account you integrated.

</Note>

6. Now click on the "Link New Table" button to link an Airtable with Formbricks and a modal will open up.

<MdxImage
  src={LinkSurveyWithTable}
  alt="Link Formbricks with a Airtable"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

7. Select the Base and table you want to link with Formbricks and the Survey. On doing so, you will be asked with what questions' responses you want to feed in Airtable. Select the questions and click on the "Save" button.

<MdxImage
  src={LinkWithQuestions}
  alt="Select question to link with Airtable"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"

/>

8. On submitting, the modal will close and you will see the linked table in the list of linked tables.

<MdxImage
  src={ListLinkedSurveys}
  alt="List of linked tables"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Congratulations! You have successfully linked an Airtable with Formbricks. Now whenever a response is submitted for the linked survey, it will be automatically added to the linked Airtable.
