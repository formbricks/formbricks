# Zapier Setup

Zapier is a powerful ally. Hook up Formbricks with Zapier and you can send your data to 5000+ other apps. Here is how to do it.

<Note>
  ### Nail down your survey first? Any changes in the survey cause additional work in the Zap. It makes sense to first settle on the survey you want to run and then get to setting up Zapier.
</Note>

## Step 1: Setup your survey incl. `questionId` for every question

When setting up the Zap your life will be easier when you change the `questionId`s of your survey questions. You can only do so **before** you publish your survey.

<MdxImage
  src={UpdateQuestionId}
  alt="Update Question ID"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

_In every question card in the Advanced Settings you find the Question ID field. Update it so that you’ll recognize the response tied to this question._

<Note>
  ### Already published? Duplicate survey You can only update the questionId when the survey was not yet
  published. Already published it? Just **duplicate it** to update the questionIds.
  <MdxImage
    src={DuplicateSurvey}
    alt="Duplicate Survey"
    quality="100"
    className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
  />
</Note>

## Step 2: Send a test response

In order to set up Zapier you’ll need a test response. This allows you to select the individual values of each response in your Zap. If you have Formbricks running locally and you want to set up an app or a website survey, you can use our [Demo App](/contributing/demo) to trigger a survey and submit a response.

<MdxImage
  src={SubmitTestResponse}
  alt="Submit Test Response"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 3: Setup your Zap

Go to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com) and create a new Zap. Search for “Formbricks” to get started:

<MdxImage src={AddNewZap} alt="Add New Zap" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

Then, choose the event you want to trigger the Zap on:

<MdxImage src={ChooseEvent} alt="Choose Event" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

## Step 4: Connect Formbricks with Zapier

Now, you have to connect Zapier with Formbricks via an API Key:

<MdxImage
  src={ConnectWithFB1}
  alt="Connect with Formbricks - 1"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
<MdxImage
  src={ConnectWithFB2}
  alt="Connect with Formbricks - 2"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Now you need an API key. Please refer to the [API Key Setup](/additional-features/api#how-to-generate-an-api-key) page to learn how to create one.

Once you copied it in the newly opened Zapier window, you will be connected:

<MdxImage
  src={SuccessConnection}
  alt="Successful Connection"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 5: Select Survey

Next, you can choose from all the surveys you have created in this environment:

<MdxImage
  src={SelectSurvey}
  alt="Select Survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 6: Test your trigger

Once you hit “Test” you will see the three most recent submissions for this survey. If you don’t have any submissions in the survey, submit one to continue setting up your Zap:

<MdxImage
  src={TestSubmission}
  alt="Test Submission"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
_Now you're happy that you updated the questionId's_

## Step 7: Set up your Zap

Now you have all the data you need at hand. The next steps depend on what you want to do with it. In this tutorial, we will send submissions to a Slack channel:

<MdxImage
  src={SlackChannelMsg}
  alt="Slack Channel Message"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In the action itself we can determine the data and layout of the message. Here, we only choose the submission data. You can also refer to the meta data of the submission and the [attributes](/app-surveys/user-identification) of the person who submitted the survey.

<MdxImage src={SlackMsg} alt="Slack Message" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

We now receive a notifcation in our Slack channel whenever a Churn survey is completed:

<MdxImage
  src={ZapierMessage}
  alt="Zapier Message"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
