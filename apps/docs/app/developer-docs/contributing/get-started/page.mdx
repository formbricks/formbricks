#### Contributing

# Get started

We are so happy that you are interested in contributing to Formbricks 🤗 There are many ways to contribute to Formbricks like writing issues, fixing bugs, building new features or updating the docs.

- **Issues**: Spotted a bug? Has deployment gone wrong? Do you have user feedback? [Raise an issue](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/issues/new/choose) for the fastest response.
- **Feature requests**: Raise an issue for these and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea. Please [open a feature request](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D) clearly describing the problem you want to solve.
- **How we Code at Formbricks**: [View this Notion document](https://formbricks.notion.site/How-we-code-at-Formbricks-8bcaa0304a20445db4871831149c0cf5?pvs=4) and understand the coding practises we follow so that you can adhere to them for uniformity.
- **Creating a PR**: Please fork the repository, make your changes and create a new pull request if you want to make an update.
- **E2E Tests**: [Understand how we write E2E tests](https://formbricks.notion.site/Formbricks-End-to-End-Tests-06dc830d71604deaa8da24714540f7ab?pvs=4) and make sure to consider writing a test whenever you ship a feature.
- **New Question Types**:[Follow this guide](https://formbricks.notion.site/Guidelines-for-Implementing-a-New-Question-Type-9ac0d1c362714addb24b9abeb326d1c1?pvs=4) to keep everything in mind when you want to add a new question type.
- **How to create a service**: [Read this document to understand how we use services](https://formbricks.notion.site/How-to-create-a-service-8e0c035704bb40cb9ea5e5beeeeabd67?pvs=4). This is particulalry important when you need to write a new one.

## Talk to us first

We highly recommend connecting with us on [Discord server](https://formbricks.com/discord) before you ship a contribution. This will increase the likelihood of your PR being merged. And it will decrease the likelihood of you wasting your time :)

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To be able to keep working on Formbricks over the coming years, we need to collect a CLA from all relevant contributors.

Once you open a PR, you will get a message from the CLA bot to fill out the form. Please note that we can only get your contribution merged when we have a CLA signed by you.

## Setup Dev Environment

We currently officially support the below methods to set up your development environment for Formbricks:

- [Gitpod](/docs/developer-docs/contributing/gitpod)
- [GitHub Codespaces](/docs/developer-docs/contributing/codespaces)
- [Local Machine Setup](#local-machine-setup)

Both Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces have a **generous free tier** to explore and develop. For junior developers we suggest using either of these, because you can dive into coding within minutes, not hours.

## Local Machine Setup

<Note>
The below only works for **Mac**, **Linux** & **WSL2** on Windows (not on pure Windows)!

This method is recommended **only for advanced users** & we won't be able to provide official support for this.

</Note>

To get the project running locally on your machine you need to have the following development tools installed:

- Node.JS (we recommend v20)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (to run PostgreSQL / MailHog)

1. Clone the project & move into the directory:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Git clone Formbricks monorepo">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks && cd formbricks
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

2. Install Node.JS packages via pnpm. Don't have pnpm? Get it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Install dependencies via pnpm">

```bash
pnpm install
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`. It's already preset to work with the local development setup but you can also change values if needed.

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Define environment variables">

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

4. Generate & set some secret values mandatory for the `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `CRON_SECRET` in the .env file. You can use the following command to generate the random string of required length:

- For Linux

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="For Linux">

```bash
sed -i '/^ENCRYPTION_KEY=/c\ENCRYPTION_KEY='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
sed -i '/^NEXTAUTH_SECRET=/c\NEXTAUTH_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
sed -i '/^CRON_SECRET=/c\CRON_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

- For Mac

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="For Mac">

```bash
sed -i '' '/^ENCRYPTION_KEY=/s|.*|ENCRYPTION_KEY='$(openssl rand -hex 32)'|' .env
sed -i '' '/^NEXTAUTH_SECRET=/s|.*|NEXTAUTH_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32)'|' .env
sed -i '' '/^CRON_SECRET=/s|.*|CRON_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32)'|' .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

5. Make sure you have [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) & [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and running on your machine. Then run the following command to start the Formbricks dev setup:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Start Formbricks Dev Setup">

```bash
pnpm go
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>
   This starts the Formbricks main app (plus all its dependencies) as well as the following services using Docker:

- A `postgres` container for hosting your database,
- A `mailhog` container that acts as a mock SMTP server and shows received mails in a web UI (forwarded to your host's `localhost:8025`)
- Demo App at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
- Landing Page at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

<Note>
  **WSL2 users**: If you encounter connection issues with Prisma, ensure your WSL2 instance's PostgreSQL
  service is stopped before running `pnpm go`. Use the command `sudo systemctl stop postgresql` to stop the
  service.
</Note>

**You can now access the Formbricks app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. You will be automatically redirected to the login. To use your local installation of formbricks, create a new account.

{" "}

<Note>
  A fresh setup does not have a default account. Please create a new account and proceed accordingly.
</Note>

For viewing the emails sent by the system, you can access mailhog at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)

### Build

To build all apps and packages and check for build errors, run the following command:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Build Formbricks stack">

```bash
pnpm build
```

</CodeGroup>
