# Gitpod Guide

    **Building custom image for the workspace:**
    - This includes : Installing `yq` and `turbo` globally before the workspace starts. This is accomplished within the `.gitpod.Dockerfile` along with starting upon a base custom image building on [workspace-full](https://hub.docker.com/r/workspace-full/dockerfile).

    **Initialization of Formbricks:**
     - During the prebuilds phase, we initialize Formbricks by performing the following tasks:
        1. Setting up environment variables.
        2. Installing monorepo dependencies.
        3. Installing Docker images by extracting them from the `packages/database/docker-compose.yml` file.
        4. Building the @formbricks/js component.
     - When the workspace starts:
        1. Wait for the web and demo apps to launch on Gitpod. This automatically opens the `apps/demo/.env` file. Utilize dynamic localhost URLs (e.g., `localhost:3000` for signup and `localhost:8025` for email confirmation) to configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMBRICKS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`. After creating your account and finding the `ID` in the URL at `localhost:3000`, replace `YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID` in the `.env` file located in `app/demo`.

    **Web Component Initialization:**
     - We initialize the @formbricks/web component during prebuilds. This involves:
        1. Installing build dependencies for the `@formbricks/web#go` task from turbo.json in prebuilds to save time.
        2. Starting PostgreSQL and Mailhog containers for running migrations in prebuilds.
        3. To prevent the "Init" task from running indefinitely due to prebuild rules, a cleanup `docker compose down` step i.e. `db:down` is added to `turbo.json`. This step is designed to halt the execution of containers that are currently running.
     - When the workspace starts:
        1. Initializing environment variables.
        2. Replacing `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` to take in Gitpod URL's ports when running on VSCode browser.
        3. Starting the `@formbricks/web` dev environment.

    **Demo Component Initialization:**
     - Similar to the web component, the demo component is also initialized during prebuilds. This includes:
        1. Installing build dependencies for the `formbricks/demo#go` task from turbo.json in prebuilds to save time.
        2. Caching hits and replaying builds from the `@formbricks/js` component.
     - When the workspace starts:
        1. Initializing environment variables.
        2. Replaces `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMBRICKS_API_HOST` to take in Gitpod URL's ports when running on VSCode browser.
        3. Starting the `@formbricks/demo` dev environment.

    **Github Prebuilds Configuration:**
     - This configures Github Prebuilds for the master branch, pull requests, and adding comments. This helps automate the prebuild process for the specified branches and actions.

    **VSCode Extensions:**
     - This includes a list of VSCode extensions that are added to the configuration when using Gitpod. These extensions can enhance the development experience within Gitpod.

### 1. Browser Redirection

After clicking the one-click setup button, Gitpod will open a new tab or window. Please ensure that your browser allows redirection to successfully access the services:

### 2. Authorizing in Gitpod

<MdxImage
  src={GitpodAuth}
  alt="Gitpod Auth Page"

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
- This is the Gitpod Authentication Page. It appears when you click the "Open in GitPod" button and Gitpod
needs to authenticate your access to the workspace. Click on 'Continue With Github' to authorize your GitPod
session.

### 3. Creating a New Workspace

<MdxImage
  src={GitpodNewWorkspace}
  alt="Gitpod New workspace Page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
- After authentication, Gitpod asks to create a new workspace for you. This page displays the configurations
of your workspace. - You can use either choose either VS Code Browser or VS Code Desktop editor with the
'Standard Class' for your workspace class. - If you opt for the VS Code Desktop, follow the following steps 1.
Gitpod will prompt you to grant access to the VSCode app. Once approved, install the GitPod extension from the
VSCode Marketplace and follow the prompts to authorize the integration. 2. Change the `WEBAPP_URL` to
`https://localhost:3000`

### 4. Gitpod preparing the created Workspace

<MdxImage
  src={GitpodPreparing}
  alt="Gitpod Preparing workspace Page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
- Gitpod is preparing your workspace with all the necessary dependencies and configurations. You will see this
page while Gitpod sets up your development environment.

### 5. Gitpod running the Workspace

<MdxImage
  src={GitpodRunning}
  alt="Gitpod Running Workspace Page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
- Once the workspace is fully prepared, voila, it enters the running state. You can start working on your
project in this environment.

### Ports and Services

Here are the ports and corresponding URLs for the services within your Gitpod environment:

- **Port 3000**:

  - **Service**: Demo App
  - **Description**: This port hosts the demo application of your project. You can access and interact with your application's demo by navigating to this port.

- **Port 3001**:

  - **Service**: Formbricks website
  - **Description**: This port hosts the [Formbricks](https://formbricks.com) website, which contains documents, pricing, blogs, best practices, and concierge service.

- **Port 3002**:

  - **Service**: Formbricks In-product Survey Demo App
  - **Description**: This app helps you test your app & website surveys. You can create and test user actions, create and update user attributes, etc.

- **Port 5432**:

  - **Service**: PostgreSQL Database Server
  - **Description**: The PostgreSQL DB is hosted on this port.

- **Port 1025**:

  - **Service**: SMTP server
  - **Description**: SMTP Server for sending and receiving email messages. This server is responsible for handling email communication.

- **Port 8025**:
  - **Service**: Mailhog

### Accessing port URLs

1. **Direct URL Composition**:

- You can access the dedicated port URL by pre-pending the port number to the workspace URL.
- For example, if you want to access port 3000, you can use the URL format: `3000-yourworkspace.ws-eu45.gitpod.io`.

2. **Using [gp CLI](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references-cli)**:

- Gitpod provides a convenient command, `gp url`, to quickly retrieve the URL for a specific port.
- Simply use the command followed by the desired port number. For example, to get the URL for port 3000, run: `gp url 3000`.

3. **Listing All Open Port URLs**:

- If you prefer to see a list of all open port URLs at once, you can use the `gp ports list` command.
- Running this command will display a list of ports along with their corresponding URLs.

4. **Viewing All Ports in Panel**:

- Gitpod also offers a user-friendly 'Ports' tab in the Gitpod panel.
- Click on the 'Ports' tab to view a list of all open ports and their respective URLs.
