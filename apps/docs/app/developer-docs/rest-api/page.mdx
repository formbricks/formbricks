# API Overview

Formbricks offers two types of APIs: the **Public Client API** and the **Management API**. Each API serves a different purpose, has different authentication requirements, and provides access to different data and settings.

View our [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh) in more than 30 frameworks and languages.

## Public Client API

The [Public Client API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#5c981d9e-5e7d-455d-9795-b9c45bc2f930) is designed for our SDKs and **does not require authentication**. This API is ideal for client-side interactions, as it doesn't expose sensitive information.

We currently have the following Client API methods exposed and below is their documentation attached in Postman:

- [Actions API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#b8f3a10e-1642-4d82-a629-fef0a8c6c86c) - Create actions for a Person
- [Displays API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#949272bf-daec-4d72-9b52-47af3d74a62c) - Mark Survey as Displayed or Update an existing Display by linking it with a Response for a Person
- [People API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#ee3d2188-4253-4bca-9238-6b76455805a9) - Create & Update a Person (e.g. attributes, email, userId, etc)
- [Responses API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#8c773032-536c-483c-a237-c7697347946e) - Create & Update a Response for a Survey

## Management API

The [Management API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11026000/2sA3Bq5XEh#98fce5a1-1365-4125-8de1-acdb28206766) provides access to all data and settings that your account has access to in the Formbricks app. This API **requires a personal API Key** for authentication, which can be generated in the Settings section of the Formbricks app. Checkout the [API Key Setup](#how-to-generate-an-api-key) below to generate & manage API Keys.

We currently have the following Management API methods exposed and below is their documentation attached in Postman:

## How to Generate an API key

The API requests are authorized with a personal API key. This API key gives you the same rights as if you were logged in at formbricks.com - **don't share it around!**

1. Go to your settings on [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com).
2. Go to page “API keys”
   <MdxImage src={AddApiKey} alt="Add API Key" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />
3. Create a key for the development or production environment.
4. Copy the key immediately. You won’t be able to see it again.
   <MdxImage
     src={ApiKeySecret}
     alt="API Key Secret"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

<Note>
  ### Store API key safely! Anyone who has your API key has full control over your account. For security
  reasons, you cannot view the API key again.
</Note>
