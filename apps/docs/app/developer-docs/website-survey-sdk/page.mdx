# SDK: Run Surveys On Public Websites

### Overview

The Formbricks JS SDK is a 2-in-1 SDK for seamlessly integrating both App Surveys and Website Surveys into your projects. In this section, we'll explore how to leverage the SDK specifically for website surveys.

### Install

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="npm">

```js {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm install @formbricks/js
```

```js {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add @formbricks/js
```

```js {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @formbricks/js
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## Methods

### Initialize Formbricks

Initialize the Formbricks JS Client specifically for website surveys, ideal for public-facing websites:

<Note>you cannot set any other attribute other than language (optional) in website surveys.</Note>

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Initialize Formbricks">

```javascript
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js/website";

formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<your-environment-id>", // required
  apiHost: "<your-api-host>", // required
  attributes: {
    // optional
    language: "de", // optional
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The moment you initialise Formbricks, your users will start seeing surveys that get triggered on simpler actions such as on New Session, Page Exit, & other custom actions!

<Note>
Formbricks JS is a client SDK meant to be run client-side in their browser so make sure the window object is accessible. Below is an example of how you can set it!

<Col>
<CodeGroup>

```js
if (window !== undefined) {
  formbricks.init({
    environmentId: "<your-environment-id>",
    apiHost: "<your-api-host>",
  });
} else {
  console.error("Window object not accessible to init Formbricks");
}
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

</Note>

### Track Action

Track session actions to trigger surveys based on their interactions on your website, such as button clicks or scrolling:

<Col>
<CodeGroup>

```js
formbricks.track("Clicked on Claim");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Reset

Reset the current instance and fetch the latest surveys and state again:

<Col>
<CodeGroup>

```js
formbricks.reset();
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Register Route Change:

Listen for page changes and dynamically show surveys configured via no-code actions in the Formbricks website:

<Note>
  This is only needed when your framework has a custom routing system and you want to trigger surveys on route
  changes. For example: NextJs
</Note>

<Col>
<CodeGroup>

```js
formbricks.registerRouteChange();
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## Debug Mode

To enable debug mode in Formbricks, add `?formbricksDebug=true` to your app’s URL.

For example, if you’ve integrated Formbricks JS to your app hosted at `https://example.com`, then change the URL to `https://example.com?formbricksDebug=true` and refresh the page, now view the console logs to see the debug mode live in action.

This activates detailed debug messages in the browser console, providing deeper insights into Formbricks' operation and potential issues.

## Troubleshooting

In case you don’t see your survey right away, here's what you can do. Go through these to find the error fast:

### Formbricks Cloud and your website are not connected properly.

Go back to [app.formbricks.com](http://app.formbricks.com) or your self-hosted instance's URL and go to the Website connection in the Configuration. If the status is still indicated as “Not connected” your app hasn't yet pinged the Formbricks Cloud:

<MdxImage
  src={I1}
  alt="setup checklist ui of survey popup for website surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
**How to fix it:**

1. Check if your website loads the Formbricks widget correctly.
2. Make sure you have `debug` mode enabled in your integration and you should see the Formbricks debug logs in your browser console while being in your app (right click in the browser, `Inspect`, switch to the console tab). If you don’t see them, double check your integration.
