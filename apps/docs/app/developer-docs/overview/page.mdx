# Overview

Welcome to the Developer Docs section, your comprehensive resource for integrating and utilizing Formbricks SDKs &APIs, as well as contributing to our open source codebase. Here's what you can expect to find in this section:

### [SDK: React Native Apps](/developer-docs/react-native-in-app-surveys)

The Formbricks React Native SDK for App Surveys is designed for React Native applications, enabling seamless integration of surveys within your mobile apps. Dive into the documentation to learn how to leverage the SDK for app surveys and engage with your users effectively.

### [SDK: Formbricks JS](/developer-docs/js-sdk)

The Formbricks JS SDK is a versatile solution for both web apps and public websites. It adapts based on how you provide user information.

If a `userId` is provided, the SDK tailors surveys for logged-in users, enabling targeted and identified interactions. This allows for advanced user tracking, providing deeper insights into user behavior within your application.

Alternatively, when no `userId` is supplied, the SDK seamlessly handles surveys for public-facing websites, making it ideal for high-traffic pages without authentication. This enables efficient survey collection without requiring user identification.
