# Show Survey to % of Users

To target specific segments of your audience or manage survey exposure, Formbricks allows you to display surveys to only a percentage of your targeted users.

<Note>
  This feature is applicable for website surveys and app surveys, where managing participant engagement and
  response volume is crucial.
</Note>

## **Enabling Percentage-Based Visibility**

Set up this feature to control how many users see your survey, using a simple slider to specify the percentage of your targeted audience that should be prompted to participate.

### **Steps to Set Up Percentage-Based Visibility**

1. **Open Survey Editor**: Navigate to the survey where you wish to configure visibility settings & click on Edit.
2. **Access Settings**: In the Survey Editor, click on the **`Settings`** tab
3. **Navigate to Survey Trigger Options**:

   {" "}

   <MdxImage
     src={StepOne}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

   - Select **`Survey Trigger`** from the menu options.
   - Choose **`Survey Display Settings`** to access visibility controls.

4. **Adjust User Visibility Percentage**:

   - Find the **`Show Survey to % of Users`** toggle. Enable it.
   - Enter the desired percentage (from 0.01% to 100%) of users to whom the survey will be shown.

   {" "}

   <MdxImage
     src={StepTwo}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

<Note>
  Please note that this feature operates based on mathematical probabilistic functions, which may result in
  slight variations in the exact percentage of users who see the survey.{" "}
</Note>

### **Example Usage**

For instance, if you want to expose your survey to only half of your targeted user base, simply adjust the slider to show the survey to 50% of your users. This functionality allows you to conduct A/B testing or control the rollout of new surveys to gauge initial reactions before a wider release.

### **Application**

It's effective for:

- **A/B Testing**: Compare different user experiences by showing different surveys or survey variations to different segments of your audience.
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Gradually introduce a new survey to a portion of your users to monitor initial responses and adjust based on feedback before full deployment.
- **Load Management**: Manage server load and response processing by limiting the number of responses collected at any given time.

## **Conclusion**

Using the **Show Survey to % of Users** feature allows for precise control over who sees your Formbricks surveys, making it an invaluable feature for targeted data collection and user experience management. By adjusting survey visibility settings, you can strategically engage segments of your audience, enhance survey testing phases, and optimize overall survey effectiveness.
