# Cluster Setup

<Note>
  Running Formbricks in a multi-instance cluster configuration is an Enterprise Edition feature and requires an enterprise license key.
</Note>

## Overview

Running Formbricks as a cluster of multiple instances offers several key advantages:

- **High Availability**: Ensure your surveys remain accessible even if some instances fail
- **Load Distribution**: Handle higher traffic by distributing requests across multiple instances
- **Scalability**: Easily scale horizontally by adding more instances as your needs grow
- **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Rolling updates without service interruption

## Requirements

To run Formbricks in a cluster setup, you'll need:

- Enterprise Edition license key
- Shared PostgreSQL database
- Shared Redis cache for session management and caching
- Load balancer to distribute traffic

## Redis Configuration

<Note>
  Redis integration is an Enterprise Edition feature and requires an enterprise license key.
</Note>

Configure Redis by adding the following environment variables to your instances:

```sh {{ title: 'env file' }}
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
REDIS_HTTP_URL=http://your-redis-host:8000
```

## Coming Soon

We're working on comprehensive Kubernetes deployment instructions to make cluster setup even easier. This will include:

- Kubernetes manifests
- Helm charts
- Detailed scaling configurations
- Production-ready deployment examples

Stay tuned for updates.
