#### Self-Hosting

# License

The Formbricks core source code is licensed under AGPLv3 and available on GitHub. Additionally, we offer features for bigger organisations & enterprises under a separate, paid Enterprise License. This assures the long-term sustainability of the open source project. All free features are listed [below](#what-features-are-free).

## Enterprise Edition

Additional to the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core, the Formbricks repository contains code licensed under our **[Enterprise License](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/web/modules/ee/LICENSE)**. This additional functionality is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core and is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an **Enterprise License Key** to unlock it. For the pricing, please refer to [Formbricks Pricing](https://formbricks.com/pricing) or [get in touch](https://cal.com/johannes/license).
