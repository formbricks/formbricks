## OAuth Configuration

### Google OAuth

Integrating Google OAuth with your Formbricks instance allows users to log in using their Google credentials, ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Google OAuth for your Formbricks instance.

#### Requirements:

- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
- A Formbricks instance running and accessible.

#### Steps:

1. **Create a GCP Project**:

   - Navigate to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.

2. **Setting up OAuth 2.0**:

   - If the **APIs & services** page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select **APIs & services**.
   - On the left, click **Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials**, then select **OAuth client ID**.

3. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:

   - If this is your first time creating a client ID, configure your consent screen by clicking **Consent Screen**.
   - Fill in the necessary details and under **Authorized domains**, add the domain where your Formbricks instance is hosted.

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**:
   - Select the application type **Web application** for your project and enter any additional information required.
   - Ensure to specify authorized JavaScript origins and authorized redirect URIs.

<Col>
  <CodeGroup title="Configuration URLs">
    ``` {{ title: "Redirect & Origin URLs" }}
    Authorized JavaScript origins: {WEBAPP_URL}
    Authorized redirect URIs: {WEBAPP_URL}/api/auth/callback/google ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Col>

5. **Update Environment Variables in Docker**:
   - To integrate the Google OAuth, you have two options: either update the environment variables in the docker-compose file or directly add them to the running container.
   - In your Docker setup directory, open the `.env` file, and add or update the following lines with the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` obtained from Google Cloud Platform:
   - Alternatively, you can add the environment variables directly to the running container using the following commands (replace `container_id` with your actual Docker container ID):

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Set env vars">

```sh {{ title: 'Shell commands' }}
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
exit
```

```sh {{ title: 'env file' }}
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

6. **Restart Your Formbricks Instance**:
   - **Note:** Restarting your Docker containers may cause a brief period of downtime. Plan accordingly.
   - Once the environment variables have been updated, it's crucial to restart your Docker containers to apply the changes. This ensures that your Formbricks instance can utilize the new Google OAuth configuration for user authentication. Here's how you can do it:
   - Navigate to your Docker setup directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
   - Run the following command to bring down your current Docker containers and then bring them back up with the updated environment configuration:

### Azure SSO OAuth

Have an Azure Active Directory (AAD) instance? Integrate it with your Formbricks instance to allow users to log in using their existing AAD credentials. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Azure SSO for your Formbricks instance.

### Requirements

- An Azure Active Directory (AAD) instance.
- A Formbricks instance running and accessible.

### Steps

1. Create a new Tenant in Azure Active Directory as per their [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant).
2. Add Users & Groups to your AAD instance.
3. Now we need to fill the below environment variables in our Formbricks instance so get them from your AD configuration:
   - `AZUREAD_CLIENT_ID`
   - `AZUREAD_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `AZUREAD_TENANT_ID`
4. Update these environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` or pass it like your other environment variables to the Formbricks container.
5. Restart your Formbricks instance.
6. You're all set! Users can now signup & log in using their AAD credentials.

## OpenID Configuration

Integrating your own OIDC (OpenID Connect) instance with your Formbricks instance allows users to log in using their OIDC credentials, ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience. Please follow the steps below to set up OIDC for your Formbricks instance.

1. Configure your OIDC provider & get the following variables:
   - `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
   - `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `OIDC_ISSUER`
   - `OIDC_SIGNING_ALGORITHM`

<Note>
  Make sure the Redirect URI for your OIDC Client is set to `{WEBAPP_URL}/api/auth/callback/openid`.
</Note>

2. Update these environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` or pass it directly to the running container.

An example configuration for a FusionAuth OpenID Connect in Formbricks would look like:

<Col>
  <CodeGroup title="Formbricks Env for FusionAuth OIDC">
    ```yml {{ title: ".env" }}
    OIDC_CLIENT_ID=59cada54-56d4-4aa8-a5e7-5823bbe0e5b7
    OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=4f4dwP0ZoOAqMW8fM9290A7uIS3E8Xg29xe1umhlB_s
    OIDC_ISSUER=http://localhost:9011
    OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME=FusionAuth OIDC_SIGNING_ALGORITHM=HS256
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Col>

3. Set an environment variable `OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME` to the display name of your OIDC provider.

4. Restart your Formbricks instance.

5. You're all set! Users can now signup & log in using their OIDC credentials.
