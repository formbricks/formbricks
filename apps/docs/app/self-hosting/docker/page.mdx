};

#### Self-Hosting

# Advanced Setup

Quickly set up and start using Formbricks with our [official Docker image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/pkgs/container/formbricks) that we've already built for you.

The pre-built image is ready-to-run, and it only requires minimal configuration on your part. It's as easy as downloading the Docker image and firing up the container.

### Requirements

Ensure `docker` & `docker compose` are installed on your server/system. Both are typically included with Docker utilities, like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

<Note>
  `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the
  Docker documentation.
</Note>

## Start

1.  **Create a New Directory for Formbricks**

Open a terminal and create a new directory for Formbricks, then navigate into this new directory:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Create and cd into the new directory">

    ```bash
    mkdir formbricks-quickstart && cd formbricks-quickstart
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

2.  **Download the Docker-Compose File**

Download the docker-compose file directly from the Formbricks repository:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Download docker compose file">

    ```bash
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

3.  **Generate NextAuth Secret**

Next, you need to generate a NextAuth secret. This will be used for session signing and encryption. The `sed` command below generates a random string using `openssl`, then replaces the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET:` placeholder in the `docker-compose.yml` file with this generated secret:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Generate NextAuth Secret">

    ```bash
    sed -i "/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:$/s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

4.  **Generate Encryption Key**

Next, you need to generate an Encryption Key. This will be used for authenticating and verifying 2 Factor Authentication. The `sed` command below generates a random string using `openssl`, then replaces the `ENCRYPTION_KEY:` placeholder in the `docker-compose.yml` file with this generated secret:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Generate Encryption Key">

    ```bash
    sed -i "/ENCRYPTION_KEY:$/s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

5.  **Generate Cron Secret**

Next, you need to generate a Cron secret. This will be used as an API Secret for running cron jobs. The `sed` command below generates a random string using `openssl`, then replaces the `CRON_SECRET:` placeholder in the `docker-compose.yml` file with this generated secret:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Generate Cron Secret">

    ```bash
    sed -i "/CRON_SECRET:$/s/CRON_SECRET:.*/CRON_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

6.  **Start the Docker Setup**

You're now ready to start the Formbricks Docker setup. The following command will start Formbricks together with a postgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Launch Docker Instance">

```bash
 docker compose up -d
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>
   The `-d` flag will run the containers in detached mode, meaning they'll run in the background.

7. **Visit Formbricks in Your Browser**

   After starting the Docker setup, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the Formbricks application. The first time you access this page, you'll be greeted by a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to define your first user and get started.

## Update

<Note>
  Please take a look at our [migration guide](/self-hosting/migration-guide) for version specific steps to
  update Formbricks.
</Note>

1.  Pull the latest Formbricks image

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Pull the changes into docker">

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

2.  Stop the Formbricks stack

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Stop the docker instance">

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

3.  Re-start the Formbricks stack with the updated image

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Relaunch the Docker Instance">

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Look into docker logs">

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
In an ideal case, you should see something like this:
