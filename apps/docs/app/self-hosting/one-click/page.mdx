#### Self-Hosting

# One-Click Setup

<Note>This only works with an Ubuntu machine so please verify the underlying OS beforehand!</Note>

If you want to quickly set up a production instance of Formbricks on a server running Ubuntu, we've got you covered! This method utilizes a convenient shell script that takes care of everything, including **Docker**, **Postgres DB**, and **SSL certificate configuration**. The shell script will automatically install all the required dependencies and configure your server, making the process a breeze.

<Note>
  This setup installs **Traefik** to work as a **reverse proxy**. This configuration is crucial for directing
  incoming traffic to the correct container, allowing Formbricks to be accessible from the internet securely.
  Traefik is chosen for its simplicity and automatic SSL management with Let's Encrypt.
</Note>

If you want to run Formbricks on a different OS or have more control over the installation process, you can follow the [advanced installation guide with Docker](/self-hosting/docker).

### Requirements

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following:

- A **Linux Ubuntu** Virtual Machine deployed with SSH access.
- An **A record** set up to connect a custom domain to your instance. Formbricks will **automatically create an SSL certificate** for your domain using Let's Encrypt.
- **Port 80 and 443** open in your VM's Security Group to allow Traefik to create the SSL certificate.

## Start

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Single Command to deploy Formbricks">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/formbricks.sh -o formbricks.sh && chmod +x formbricks.sh && ./formbricks.sh install
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The script will prompt you for the following information:

1. **Overwriting Docker GPG Keys**: If Docker GPG keys already exist, the script will ask if you want to overwrite them.

## Update

To update Formbricks, simply run the following command:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Update Formbricks">

```bash
./formbricks.sh update
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The script will automatically pull the latest version of Formbricks from GitHub Container Registry and restart the containers.

## Stop

To stop Formbricks, simply run the following command:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Stop Formbricks">

```bash
./formbricks.sh stop
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The script will automatically stop all the Formbricks related containers and brings the entire stack down.

## Restart

To restart Formbricks, simply run the following command:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Restart Formbricks">

```bash
./formbricks.sh restart
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The script will automatically restart all the Formbricks related containers and brings the entire stack up with the previous configuration.

## Uninstall

To uninstall Formbricks, simply run the following command, but keep in mind that this will delete all your data!

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Uninstall Formbricks">

```bash
./formbricks.sh uninstall
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The script will automatically stop all the Formbricks related containers, remove the Formbricks directory, and delete the Docker network.

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the containers with:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Check logs of the container">

```bash
./formbricks.sh logs
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

- **Inbound Rules**: Make sure you have added inbound rules for Port 80 and 443 in your VM's Security Group.

- **A Record**: Verify that you have set up an A record for your domain, pointing to your VM's IP address.

- **Check Docker Instances**: Run `docker ps` to check the status of the Docker instances.

- **Check Formbricks Logs**: Run `cd formbricks && docker compose logs` to check the logs of the Formbricks stack.
