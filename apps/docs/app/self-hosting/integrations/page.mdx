## n8n

Enabling the n8n integration in a self-hosted environment requires a new workflow setup using n8n and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

1.Setup your n8n workflow: Go to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) and create a new workflow. Search for “Formbricks” to get started:

<MdxImage
  src={AddFormbricksTrigger}
  alt="Add Formbricks Trigger"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2.Connect Formbricks with n8n: Now, you have to connect n8n with Formbricks via an API Key:

<MdxImage

/>

3. Click on Create New Credentail button to add your host and API Key

<MdxImage
  src={AddApiKey}
  alt="Add host and api key"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Now you need an API key. Please refer to the [API Key Setup](/additional-features/api#how-to-generate-an-api-key) page to learn how to create one.

Once you copied it in the API Key field, hit Save button to test the connection and save the credentials.

<MdxImage

  alt="Successful Connection"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. Select Event: Next, you can choose the event you want to trigger the node on. You can select multiple events:

<MdxImage src={SelectEvent} alt="Select Event" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

Here, we are adding `Response Finished` as an event, which will trigger when the survey has been filled out.

5. Select Survey: Next, you can choose from all the surveys you have created in this environment. You can select multiple surveys:

<MdxImage
  src={SelectSurvey}
  alt="Select Survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Here, we are selecting two surveys.

<MdxImage
  src={SelectedSurveys}
  alt="Selected Surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

6. Test your trigger: In order to set up n8n you'll need a test response in the selected survey. This allows you to select the individual values of each response in your workflow. If you have Formbricks running locally and you want to set up an app survey, you can use our [Demo App](/contributing/demo) to trigger a survey and submit a response.

<MdxImage
  src={SubmitTestResponse}
  alt="Submit Test Response"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Next, click on Listen for event button.

<MdxImage
  src={ListenForEvent}
  alt="Listen for event"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Then, go to the survey which you selected. Fill it out, and wait for the particular event to trigger (in this case it's `Response Finished`). Once the event is triggered you will see the response that you filled out in the survey.

<MdxImage
  src={TestResponseSuccess}
  alt="Test Response Success"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Now you have all the data you need at hand. The next steps depend on what you want to do with it. In this tutorial, we will send submissions to a discord channel:

7. Add discord to your workflow: Click on the plus and search `Discord`.

<MdxImage src={AddDiscord} alt="Add Discord" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

Fill in the `Webhook URL` and the `Content` that you want to receive in the respective discord channel. Next, click on `Execute Node` button to test the node.

<MdxImage
  src={FillDiscordDetails}
  alt="Fill Discord Details"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Once the execution is successful, you'll receive the content in the discord channel.

<MdxImage
  src={DiscordResponse}
  alt="Discord Response"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
