#### Self-Hosting

# Migration Guide

## v2.4

Formbricks v2.4 allows you to create multiple endings for your surveys and decide which ending the user should see based on logic jumps. This release also includes many bug fixes and performance improvements.

<Note>
  This release will drop support for advanced targeting (enterprise targeting for app surveys) with actions
  (e.g. only target users that triggered action x 3 times in the last month). This means that actions can
  still be used as triggers, but will no longer be stored on the server in order to improve the overall
  performance of the Formbricks system.
</Note>

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users who are self-hosting Formbricks using our one-click setup. If you are using a different setup, you might adjust the commands accordingly.

To run all these steps, please navigate to the `formbricks` folder where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

1. **Backup your Database**: This is a crucial step. Please make sure to backup your database before proceeding with the upgrade. You can use the following command to backup your database:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Backup Postgres">

```bash
docker exec formbricks-postgres-1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres -d formbricks > formbricks_pre_v2.4_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

<Note>
  If you run into “No such container”, use `docker ps` to find your container name, e.g.
  `formbricks_postgres_1`.
</Note>

<Note>
  If you prefer storing the backup as an `*.sql` file remove the `-Fc` (custom format) option. In case of a
  restore scenario you will need to use `psql` then with an empty `formbricks` database.
</Note>

2. Pull the latest version of Formbricks:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Stop the containers">

```bash
docker compose pull
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

3. Stop the running Formbricks instance & remove the related containers:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Stop the containers">

```bash
docker compose down
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

4. Restarting the containers with the latest version of Formbricks:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Restart the containers">

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

5. Now let's migrate the data to the latest schema:

<Note>To find your Docker Network name for your Postgres Database, find it using `docker network ls`</Note>

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Migrate the data">

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:latest && \
docker run --rm \
  --network=formbricks_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/formbricks?schema=public" \
  -e UPGRADE_TO_VERSION="v2.4" \
  ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:latest
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The above command will migrate your data to the latest schema. This is a crucial step to migrate your existing data to the new structure. Only if the script runs successful, changes are made to the database. The script can safely run multiple times.

6. That's it! Once the migration is complete, you can **now access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

### Additional Updates

- The `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is now required to improve the security of the internal cron APIs. Please make sure that the variable is set in your environment / docker-compose.yml. You can use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a secure secret.

## v2.3

Formbricks v2.3 includes new color options for rating questions, improved multi-language functionality for Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), and various bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Steps to Migrate

<Note>
  You only need to run the data migration if you have multi language surveys set up in the Chinese language
  (`zh`). If you don't have any surveys in Chinese, you can skip the data migration step.
</Note>

This guide is for users who are self-hosting Formbricks using our one-click setup. If you are using a different setup, you might adjust the commands accordingly.

To run all these steps, please navigate to the `formbricks` folder where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

1. **Backup your Database**: This is a crucial step. Please make sure to backup your database before proceeding with the upgrade. You can use the following command to backup your database:

```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

<Note>
  If you run into “No such container”, use `docker ps` to find your container name, e.g.
  `formbricks_postgres_1`.
</Note>

<Note>
  If you prefer storing the backup as an `*.sql` file remove the `-Fc` (custom format) option. In case of a
  restore scenario you will need to use `psql` then with an empty `formbricks` database.
</Note>

2. Pull the latest version of Formbricks:

```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The above command will migrate your data to the latest schema. This is a crucial step to migrate your existing data to the new structure. Only if the script runs successful, changes are made to the database. The script can safely run multiple times.

6. That's it! Once the migration is complete, you can **now access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

### Additional Updates

The feature to create short urls in Formbricks is now deprecated. Previously generated short urls will keep working for now but we recommend to use the long urls instead. Redirect support for short urls will be removed in a future release.

## v2.2

Formbricks v2.2 introduces XM research presets into your products with a brand new product onboarding. Our objective is to make user research “obviously easy”, industry by industry. And we're starting with Software-as-a-Service and E-Commerce.

### Changes in Environment Variables

- `ONBOARDING_DISABLED` is now deprecated since we replaced the user onboarding with a product onboarding that only runs when creating a new product.

## v2.1

Formbricks v2.1 introduces more options for creating No-Code Actions and lays the foundation for easier self-hosting of Formbricks starting with an Onboarding for fresh instances.

<Note>
  To improve the user experience in self-hosting instances and to simplify setup, we are moving to a single
  organization approach for self-hosting instances with this release. This will allow self-hosters to
  centrally manage their instance and more easily restrict access to the instance. We will soon introduce a
  new permissions system that will allow more granular access to projects and other resources within an
  organization. If you have created multiple organizations in the past, you will still be able to switch
  between them in the UI, but don't have an option to create new organizations.
</Note>

### Changes in Environment Variables

- `SIGNUP_DISABLED` is now deprecated since self-hosting instaces have signup disabled by default and new users can only be invited by the organization owner or admin.
- `DEFAULT_TEAM_ID` got renamed to `DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `DEFAULT_TEAM_ROLE` got renamed to `DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ROLE`

```bash
docker exec -i formbricks-quickstart-postgres-1 pg_restore --clean -U postgres -v -d formbricks < formbricks_pre_v1.6_<timestamp_of_your_dump_file>.dump
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

<Note>Replace the path to `formbricks_pre_v1.6_<timestamp_of_your_dump_file>.dump` with the exact path to your `.dump` file.</Note>

<Note>This will wipe the database and restore from the `.dump` file</Note>

### App Surveys with @formbricks/js

If you are using the `@formbricks/js` package, please make sure to update it to version `~1.6.5` to use the latest features and improvements.

## v1.2

Formbricks v1.2 ships a lot of features targeting our Link Surveys. We have also improved our security posture to be as robust as ever. However, it also comes with a few breaking changes specifically with the environment variables. This guide will help you migrate your existing Formbricks instance to v1.2 without any hassles or build errors.

### New Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Required | Recommended Generation  | Comments                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SURVEY_BASE_URL      | The WEBAPP_URL is now used to determine the survey base url in all places |

## v1.1

Formbricks v1.1 includes a lot of new features and improvements. However, it also comes with a few breaking changes specifically with the environment variables. This guide will help you migrate your existing Formbricks instance to v1.1 without losing any data.

### Renamed Environment Variables

This was introduced because we got a lot of requests from our users for the ability to define some common environment variables at runtime itself i.e. without having to rebuild the image for the changes to take effect.
This is now possible with v1.1. However, due to Next.JS best practices, we had to deprecate the prefix **NEXT*PUBLIC*** in the following environment variables:

| till v1.0                               | v1.1                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED | EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_RESET_DISABLED     | PASSWORD_RESET_DISABLED     |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNUP_DISABLED             | SIGNUP_DISABLED             |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_INVITE_DISABLED             | INVITE_DISABLED             |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVACY_URL                 | PRIVACY_URL                 |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_TERMS_URL                   | TERMS_URL                   |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_IMPRINT_URL                 | IMPRINT_URL                 |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED         | GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED         |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED         | GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED         |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL                  | WEBAPP_URL                  |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_FORMBRICKS_CLOUD         | IS_FORMBRICKS_CLOUD         |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_SURVEY_BASE_URL             | SURVEY_BASE_URL             |

<Note>
  Please note that their values and the logic remains exactly the same. Only the prefix has been deprecated.
  The other environment variables remain the same as well.
</Note>

### Deprecated Environment Variables

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL**: Was used as Vercel URL (used instead of WEBAPP_URL), but from v1.1, you can just set the WEBAPP_URL environment variable to your Vercel URL.

### Helper Shell Script

For a seamless migration, below is a shell script for your self-hosted instance that will automatically update your environment variables to be compliant with the new naming conventions.

### Docker & Single Script Setup

Now that these variables can be defined at runtime, you can append them inside your `x-environment` in the `docker-compose.yml` itself.
For a more detailed guide on these environment variables, please refer to the [Important Runtime Variables](/self-hosting/docker#important-run-time-variables) section.
