# Advanced Targeting

Advanced Targeting allows you to show surveys to the right group of people. You can target surveys based on user attributes, device type, and more instead of spraying and praying. This helps you get more relevant feedback and make data-driven decisions. All of this without writing a single line of code.

## How to setup Advanced Targeting

<Note>Advanced Targeting is only available on the Pro plan!</Note>

1. On the Formbricks dashboard, click on **People** tab from the top navigation bar.

2. Switch to the **Segments** tab & click on **Create Segment**.

3. Give your segment a title & a description to help you remember what this segment is about.

4. Now click on the **Add Filter** button to add a filter. You can filter based on user attributes, other segments, devices, and more.

5. To group a set of filters together, click on the Three Dots icon on the right side of the filter and click on **Create Group**.

6. Try playing around with different filters & conditions that we have provided to see how the segment size changes.

7. Once you are happy with the segment, click on **Save Segment**.

8. Now, when you create a survey, you can select this segment to target your survey to.
