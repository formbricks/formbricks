#### App Surveys

# Advanced Targeting

<Note>
  Targeting based on actions is deprecated in Advanced Targeting and will be removed soon. We recommend using
  filters on user attributes to target the survey only to specific groups of users.
</Note>

Advanced Targeting allows you to show surveys to the right group of people. You can target surveys based on user attributes, device type, and more instead of spraying and praying. This helps you get more relevant feedback and make data-driven decisions. All of this without writing a single line of code.
