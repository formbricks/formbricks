# Quickstart

App surveys have 6-10x better conversion rates than emailed surveys. This tutorial explains how to run a survey in both your web app and mobile app (React Native) in just 10 to 15 minutes. Let’s go!

1. **Create a free Formbricks Cloud account**: While you can [self-host](/self-hosting/deployment) Formbricks, but the quickest and easiest way to get started is with the free Cloud plan. Just [sign up here](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup) and you'll be guided to our onboarding like below, choose the "Formbricks Surveys" option:

  src={I1}
  alt="Choose Formbricks Surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. **Choose your Product Channel**: On this step, you have to choose between the various channels that you want your product to be created in, you can create both app and link surveys from all the channels, but for the onboarding, please choose between the app surveys or the public website options, upon doing this, you'll be prompted to connect your app / website to formbricks.

<MdxImage
  src={I2}

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. **Connect your App/Website**: Once you get through a couple of onboarding steps, you’ll be asked to connect your app or website. This is where you’ll find the code snippet for both HTML as well as the npm package which you need to embed in your app:

<MdxImage
  src={I3}
  alt="Code snippet for connecting app with Formbricks"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Paste the code snippet in your app and reload the page. You should now see a message being displayed that your app or website is now connected with formbricks.

<MdxImage
  src={I3_1}
  alt="App connected with Formbricks"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Onboarding is complete! Now let’s create our first survey as you should see templates to choose from after clicking on **Next**:

<MdxImage
  src={I4}
  alt="Choose a survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. **Create your first survey**: To be able to see a survey in your app, you need to create one. We’ll choose one of the templates and head over to the survey settings:

Pick the Survey Type as **App Survey**.

<MdxImage
  src={I5}
  alt="Survey settings for app survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

5. **Set Trigger for the Survey**: Scroll down to Survey Trigger and click on **+ Add action**, choose **New Session**. This will cause this survey to appear when the Formbricks Widget tracks a new user session:

<MdxImage
  src={I6}
  alt="Survey trigger settings for app survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

6. **Set Recontact Options for debugging**: In Recontact Options we choose the following settings, so that we can play around with the survey more easily. By default, each survey will be shown only once to each user to prevent survey fatigue:

<Note>
  Please change this setting later on after testing your survey to prevent survey fatigue for your users.
</Note>

<MdxImage
  src={I7}
  alt="Recontact options for app survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

7. **Publish your survey**: Now hit **Publish** and you’ll be forwarded to the Summary Page. This is where you’ll find the responses to this survey.

<MdxImage
  src={I8}
  alt="Survey published successfully"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
