#### Introduction

# How Formbricks works

Formbricks is broadly composed of four elements, which enable gathering, analyzing and reporting of experience data:

1. **Survey builder**: Create and customize your surveys with a user-friendly, no-code interface.
2. **Targeting & Triggers**: Define user segments based on attributes and set event-based triggers to display your surveys to the right users at the right time.
3. **Integrations**: Seamlessly integrate Formbricks with your current stack using the provided SDKs, native integrations or open APIs.
4. **Analytics & Insights**: Analyze user responses and gain actionable insights to make informed product decisions.

## Survey builder

The survey builder is where you create and customize your surveys. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can easily add different question types, set response options, and apply your branding to the survey forms. The survey builder allows you to preview your survey in real-time, ensuring it looks and feels perfect for your users.
