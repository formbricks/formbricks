#### Link Surveys

# Start At Specific Question

You can start a survey at a specific question from the survey using the URL to skip the initial questions. This is useful when you want to link to a specific question from an external source or want to use the same survey in different parts of the user journey.

## How to Use it?

1. In the Survey Editor, open the Questions Tab and ensure the survey is set as a **Link Survey**.

2. Find the question you want to start at, click on **Show Advanced Settings**, and copy the **Question ID**.

<Note>
  Each question has a unique Question ID, which is used to identify it in the survey. You can use different Question IDs for multiple **startAt** points in the URL.
</Note>

3. Append `?startAt=question_id` to your survey's URL, replacing `question_id` with the copied Question ID.

4. Share this modified URL with your users to start the survey at the specified question.
