#### Embed Surveys

# Embed Surveys in Your Web Page

Embedding Formbricks surveys directly into your web pages allows you to integrate interactive surveys without redirecting users to a separate survey site. This method ensures a seamless integration and maintains the aesthetic continuity of your website or application.

## How to Use it?

<video autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="embed-iframe.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </source>
</video>

1. Create and publish a link survey.

2. Open survey summary page and click on **share** button on the top right.

3. In the survey share modal, click on **Embed survey** button.

4. Navigate to **Embed in a Web Page** tab and click on Copy code

5. Paste the copied iframe code into the HTML of your web page where you want the survey to appear.

<CodeGroup title="Example Embedding Code">

```html
<div style="position: relative; height:100vh; max-height:100vh; overflow:auto;">
  <iframe
    src="https://app.formbricks.com/s/<your-surveyId>"
    frameborder="0"
    style="position: absolute; left:0; top:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## Iframe Events

The iframe fires a **formbricksSurveyCompleted** event when a user finishes a survey within the embedded iframe. This event can be captured through a message listener in your webpage's JavaScript

### How to Use it?

1. Embed the Formbricks survey on your webpage using the iframe method as described above.

2. Add an event listener to your webpage’s JavaScript that listens for `message` events from the iframe.

3. Check if the received message indicates that the survey is completed by comparing the `event.data` with the value `formbricksSurveyCompleted`.

<Note>
  It is important to verify the origin of the message to ensure it comes from the iframe containing your
  survey, enhancing the security of your event handling.
</Note>

4. Implement your custom actions within the callback function based on the survey completion.

window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  // Replace 'https://app.formbricks.com' with the actual web app url
  if (event.origin === "https://app.formbricks.com" && event.data === "formbricksSurveyCompleted") {
    console.log("Survey completed!");
    // Implement your custom actions here
  }
});
