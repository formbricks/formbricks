## How it Works

To track the source of users in your link surveys effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Survey URL**: Create a Link Survey and get the sharable link. Now append the link with a `?source=<your-source>` to reference it with your campaigns and sources.

<Image
    src={ShareLink}
    alt="Share Survey Link"
    quality="100"
    className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. **Collect Data**: When users access the survey through these unique links, the URL parameters will capture the source information from which they were shared.

3. **View Responses**: Use the collected source data to analyze where your survey respondents are coming from. You can hover over the user icon in the responses tab to see the source of the user.

<Image
    src={ViewResponse}
    alt="View Source in Response"
    quality="100"
    className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. **Analyse Data**: Download all the responses as a CSV/Excel and get access to the source information. This can provide valuable insights into your audience.

Source tracking allows you to make informed decisions based on the origin of your survey participants, helping you tailor your surveys and marketing strategies accordingly.
