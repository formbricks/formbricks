# One-Click Setup

If you want to quickly set up a production instance of Formbricks on a server running Ubuntu, we've got you covered! This method utilizes a convenient shell script that takes care of everything, including Docker, Postgres DB, and SSL certificate configuration. The shell script will automatically install all the required dependencies and configure your server, making the process a breeze.

This is the quickest way to get Formbricks up and running on an Ubuntu server. The shell script will automatically install all the required dependencies and configure your server, making the process a breeze.

### Requirements

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following:

- A **Linux Ubuntu** Virtual Machine deployed with SSH access.

  <Note>This only works with an Ubuntu machine so please verify the underlying OS beforehand!</Note>

- An **A record** set up to connect a custom domain to your instance. Formbricks will **automatically create an SSL certificate** for your domain using Let's Encrypt.

## Single Command Setup

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal:
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Single Command to deploy Formbricks">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/formbricks.sh -o formbricks.sh && chmod +x formbricks.sh && ./formbricks.sh install
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
The script will prompt you for the following information:

1. **Overwriting Docker GPG Keys**: If Docker GPG keys already exist, the script will ask if you want to overwrite them.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

- **Inbound Rules**: Make sure you have added inbound rules for Port 80 and 443 in your VM's Security Group.

- **A Record**: Verify that you have set up an A record for your domain, pointing to your VM's IP address.

- **Check Docker Instances**: Run `docker ps` to check the status of the Docker instances.

- **Check Formbricks Logs**: Run `cd formbricks && docker compose logs` to check the logs of the Formbricks stack.
