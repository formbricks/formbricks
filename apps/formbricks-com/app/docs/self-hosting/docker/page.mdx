# Running Formbricks with Docker

Quickly set up and start using Formbricks without getting into the technicalities of the build process. You'll be using an image that we've already built for you. The pre-built image is ready-to-run, and it only requires minimal configuration on your part. This approach is perfect for getting a functional instance of Formbricks up and running with minimal hassle. It's as easy as downloading the Docker image and firing up the container.

This is ideal for those who are testing Formbricks or want to run it with minimal to no modifications. For this we use the [public Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/formbricks/formbricks) and a simple docker-compose file.

### Requirements

Ensure `docker` & `docker compose` are installed on your server/system. Both are typically included with Docker utilities, like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

<Note>
  `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the
  Docker documentation.
</Note>

1.  **Create a New Directory for Formbricks**

Open a terminal and create a new directory for Formbricks, then navigate into this new directory:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Create and cd into the new directory">

    ```bash
    mkdir formbricks-quickstart && cd formbricks-quickstart
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

2.  **Download the Docker-Compose File**

Download the docker-compose file directly from the Formbricks repository:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Download docker compose file">

    ```bash
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

3.  **Generate NextAuth Secret**

Next, you need to generate a NextAuth secret. This will be used for session signing and encryption. The `sed` command below generates a random string using `openssl`, then replaces the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET:` placeholder in the `docker-compose.yml` file with this generated secret:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Generate NextAuth Secret">

    ```bash
    sed -i "/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:$/s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

4.  **Generate Encryption Key**

Next, you need to generate an Encryption Key. This will be used for authenticating and verifying 2 Factor Authentication. The `sed` command below generates a random string using `openssl`, then replaces the `ENCRYPTION_KEY:` placeholder in the `docker-compose.yml` file with this generated secret:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Generate Encryption Key">

    ```bash
    sed -i "/ENCRYPTION_KEY:$/s/ENCRYPTION_KEY:.*/ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 32)/" docker-compose.yml
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

5.  **Start the Docker Setup**

You're now ready to start the Formbricks Docker setup. The following command will start Formbricks together with a postgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Launch Docker Instance">

```bash
 docker compose up -d
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>
   The `-d` flag will run the containers in detached mode, meaning they'll run in the background.

6. **Visit Formbricks in Your Browser**

   After starting the Docker setup, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the Formbricks application. The first time you access this page, you'll be greeted by a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to define your first user and get started.

## Updating Formbricks

1.  Stop the Formbricks stack

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Stop the docker instance">

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

2.  Pull the latest changes

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Pull the changes into docker">

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

3.  Update env vars as necessary in the docker-compose file.
4.  Re-start the Formbricks stack

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Relaunch the Docker Instance">

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Col>

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Look into docker logs">

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
In an ideal case, you should see something like this:

## Customizing the Build Time variables

To edit any of the variables that start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, you need to rebuild the Formbricks Docker Image!

</Note>

## Important Run-time Variables

These variables can be provided at the runtime i.e. in your docker-compose file.
