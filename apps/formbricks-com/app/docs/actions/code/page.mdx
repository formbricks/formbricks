#### Actions

# Code Actions

Actions can also be set in the code base. You can fire an action using `formbricks.track()`
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Track an action">

```javascript
formbricks.track("Action Name");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
Here is an example of how to fire an action when a user clicks a button:
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Track Button Click">

```javascript
const handleClick = () => {
  formbricks.track("Button Clicked");
};

return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
