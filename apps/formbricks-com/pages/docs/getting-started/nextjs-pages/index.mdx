    "Setting up Formbricks with the new Next.js 13 Pages Directory can be tricky. Follow this guide to make sure you get it right.",
};

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Formbricks SDK into a Next.js application using the Pages Directory. As the Formbricks SDK only works on the client side, it's essential to ensure proper integration to avoid any issues.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. A Next.js application with Pages Directory set up and running.
2. A Formbricks account with access to your environment ID and API host. You can find these in the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings:

## Installing Formbricks SDK

First, you need to install the Formbricks SDK using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save @formbricks/js
# or
yarn add @formbricks/js
# or
pnpm add @formbricks/js
```

## Integrating with Next.js 13 Pages Directory

Update your Pages component in the \_app.ts file like so:

```tsx
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { PagesProps } from "next/app";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js";

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  formbricks.init({
    environmentId: "your-environment-id",
    apiHost: "your-api-host", // e.g. https://app.formbricks.com
    logLevel: "debug", // remove when in production
  });
}

export default function Pages({ Component, pageProps }: PagesProps) {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Connect next.js router to Formbricks
    const handleRouteChange = formbricks?.registerRouteChange;
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);

    return () => {
      router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

## What are we doing here?

1. First we need to initialize the Formbricks SDK, making sure it only runs on the client side.
2. To connect the Next.js router to Formbricks and ensure the SDK can keep track of every page change, we are registering the route change event.

## Validate your setup

Once you have completed the steps above, you can validate your setup by checking the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings. Your widget status indicator should go from this:

<Image src={WidgetNotConnected} alt="Widget isnt connected" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

To this:

<Image src={WidgetConnected} alt="Widget is connected" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
