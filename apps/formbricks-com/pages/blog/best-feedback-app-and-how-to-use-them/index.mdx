_Only when you understand your users and customers will they come back and tell others about your service. AI makes it easier and easier to crank out code, but are you building the right thing?_

Only your users and customers can tell you.

## What’s in-app feedback, and why is it 6x better?

In-app feedback is a method of collecting feedback from users while they are using the app. Instead of redirecting users to external platforms or surveys, in-app feedback methods enable users to share their thoughts seamlessly.

“Why is it better?” you ask. Well, first of all, in-app surveys have a 6x higher response rate than emailed-out surveys. So to get the same amount of insight, you have to bother a lot fewer people. Orrr from the same number of people, you can harvest a LOT more insights.

Additionally, you get feedback directly when a user experiences your app, instead of pinging them hours later when they are in a completely different context. So in-app feedback gives you **more insights of higher quality while having to ask less often**.

### How to gather in-app feedback

Depending on the tools you use, you can collect in-app feedback through the following methods:

- **Chatbots**: Chatbots can be used to collect feedback conversationally and provide real-time support to users.
- **Embedded forms**: Embedded forms can be used to collect feedback on specific pages or workflows within the app. The huge advantage is that they seamlessly integrate into the existing UI, avoiding survey fatigue completely.
- **Feedback widget**: Feedback widgets are a valuable tool for app developers and website owners who want to gather user insights and improve their products or services. They are small snippets of code installed on the entire website.

You can change the main color of the survey and in which corner it appears. As an engineer, you can add a stylesheet to change every element in the survey. The team is currently working on a UI to make this possible with no code as well. In the medium term, Formbricks will provide an open-source SDK to embed surveys inline, instead of having them pop over. This depth of embedding is only possible due to Formbricks’ open-source approach. |

It comes with GDPR, CCPA, SOC-2, and HIPAA compliance if required - that’s great!                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 🎯🎯🎯🎯                                      | **Pre-segmentation & Targeting:** Appcues enables you to target specific segments with the experiences with the flows or NPS surveys you have created. You can segment your experiences based on new users, including or excluding a subset of users.                                                                     |
| 😍😍😍                                        | **Native Look & Feel:** Appcues is somewhat versatile in customizations. However, even after adding your brand color, the user-facing components will always look like Appcues. It feels bolted on top of your app instead of being a native part of it.                                                                  |
| <p className="whitespace-nowrap">🧠🧠🧠🧠</p> | **Insights Assistance:** Appcues lets you track key product events to better understand user behavior, all with data visualizations—no coding needed. The insights dashboard is fairly comprehensive giving you a good insight into what's happening.                                                                     |
| 🧩🧩🧩🧩                                      | **Integrations with third-party tools:** You can send data exactly where you need it with third-party integrations which include Fullstory, Google Analytics, Logrocket, and Mixpanel among others.                                                                                                                       |
| 🛠️🛠️🛠️                                        | **Extensibility:** Appcues offers some APIs for basic integrations, but they might not provide the level of control and flexibility required for more complex integrations or custom workflows. This can be frustrating for developers who need to work around API limitations to achieve desired functionality.          |
| 💸💸                                          | **Pricing:** Appcues pricing starts at $249/month for smaller apps (2.500 users) jumping to $10.500/year for the Growth plan (only yearly plan available). In the Growth plan, you get access to the majority of the really cool features. Surveying in mobile apps (iOS and Android) always costs an additional premium. |
| 🔒🔒🔒                                        | **Privacy and Compliance:** Appcues cannot be used on-premise, so the data resides within the Appcues Cloud. It comes with GDPR and CCPA compliance and requires additional work on the customer side for HIPAA compliance.                                                                                               |

**Overall**, Appcues empowers you to design personalized tooltips, tours, and modals to guide users, highlight key features, and enhance their initial journey. It can be used to gather feedback in-app but it isn’t built for that.

| 🎯🎯🎯                                          | **Pre-segmentation & Targeting:** Survicate tracks behavior in a very useful and product-agnostic way. This means that you can perform quite granular segmentation without having to set up tracking for custom events or actions. While this significantly shortens the setup time, you might not reach the exact segment you want with Survicate's built-in targeting. |
| 😍😍😍😍                                        | **Native Look & Feel:** Survicate enables you to design your surveys quite flexibly. You can change colors, fonts and even add custom CSS to get exactly the look and feel you are looking for.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠                                      | **Insights Assistance:** Survicate has a powerful analytics dashboard. They offer custom visualizations like Word Cloud for question types where it makes sense to display one. Overall, the insights section offers a lot of depth - our favorite in this comparison 👑                                                                                                 |
| 🧩🧩🧩🧩🧩                                      | **Integrations with third-party tools:** Survicate supports a significant amount of integrations. They offer two-way sync with all relevant customer data platforms as well as one-click integrations with most other common productivity and marketing tools.                                                                                                           |
| 🛠️🛠️                                            | **Extensibility:** Like most proprietary software, Survicate is not really extensible nor customizable. They offer data export via API but that's about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <p className="whitespace-nowrap">💸💸💸💸💸</p> | **Pricing:** Survicate has great value for money. You get most of the standalone survey products for $50/month. However, this does not include website or mobile app surveys, which start at $112/month for 1000 responses. Anything above is on request.                                                                                                                |
| 🔒🔒                                            | **Privacy and Compliance:** As a European company, Survicate is fully GDPR compliant. There is no information about CCPA and it is not HIPAA compliant, as per their support page. Since self-hosting is not an option, Survicate cannot be used by a relevant segment of users.                                                                                         |

**Overall**, Survicate offers a lot of feature depth. Having been around for over 10 years, the team keeps shipping! It comes at a fair price and is versatile enough to cover most surveying use cases. The only downside is a lack of compliance support so big companies won't be able to use it.

These methods include user attributes and website activity like click and scroll depth, page targeting, and exit intent among others.                                                                    |

While they offer a range of options, the surveys tend to look added to the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You can also segment responses by user demographics, website activity, and other criteria to gain deeper insights into specific user groups. They also incorporate some AI to shorten the time to insight. |
| 🧩🧩🧩🧩                                      | **Integrations with third-party tools:** Qualaroo integrates with various third-party tools including Slack and Zapier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 🛠️                                            | **Extensibility:** Since its internal workings are not readily accessible (as it’s not open-sourced), developers are limited in their ability to augment the platform's core functionality and tailor it to specific needs. Qualaroo does not provide APIs for developers to build on top of it.                                                                                               |
| 💸💸💸                                        | **Pricing:** Qualaroo is pretty cheap for small amounts of responses. You can access the complete product for $19.99 with 100 responses/month. If you need more, you need to reach out to their sales team.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <p className="whitespace-nowrap">🔒🔒🔒🔒</p> | **Privacy and Compliance:** Qualaroo cannot be self-hosted, so the data resides within the US-based cloud. The privacy compliance information is not super comprehensive, but it seems that Qualaroo supports GDPR, CCPA, and even HIPAA compliance.                                                                                                                                           |

**Overall**, Qualaroo is a somewhat dated but solid solution to run surveys on public websites.
