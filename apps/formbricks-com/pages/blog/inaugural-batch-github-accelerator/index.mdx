## Hey there,

fellow open-source enthusiasts! We've got some fantastic news: Formbricks has been chosen for the inaugural GitHub Accelerator program!

Launched in November 2022, the GitHub Accelerator program is all about fostering a sustainable open-source ecosystem and helping projects like ours turn into full-time careers. We're stoked to be **one of the 20 projects in the 2023 cohort, chosen from a whopping 1,000+ applications.**

As part of the GitHub Accelerator, we'll be attending weekly sessions with open-source gurus, diving into topics like licensing, governance, funding goals, sponsorships, and a whole lot more. Once we've soaked up all that knowledge, we'll share our learnings and experiences with the ever-growing open-source community.

This opportunity is a game-changer for Formbricks, as the support from the GitHub Accelerator will help us level up our platform even more. It's a massive win for everyone who loves open-source experience management solutions, and we can't wait to see where this journey takes us!
