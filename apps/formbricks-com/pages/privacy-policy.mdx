## **Introduction**

We take your data privacy serious. It is our highest priority to offer a privacy-first solution, both self-hosted and in our managed cloud. We take on considerable additional effort to collect as little data as neccessary and handle it safely and securely.

This Privacy Policy explains how and why our organization collects personal data and how it is used. If you have any questions after reading this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at **privacy@formbricks.com**

### Important Notice

This Privacy Policy only applies to the Formbricks Cloud under [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com) (”Cloud”) and our Landing Page under formbricks.com. (”Landing Page”) If you are self-hosting our open source tool on your own servers, this Privacy Policy does not apply.

### Definitions

To avoid confusion, let’s define who we collect data from:

- Researcher: the person who uses the Cloud to create and distribute Formbricks forms and surveys or manage submissions from other forms
- Website visitors: People who visit our marketing landing page

### We are data processor, you are data controller

With our Cloud we are a provider of this Service. We are not the owner of the collected personal data from survey respondents. The Researcher (the person who sends out a form i.e. you) is responsible for the data they collect and thus data controller of respondent data.

## **Data do we collect**

This is the information we collect from **Website visitors** and **Researchers** as long as you are using our Service:

- **Electronical identification data**: including anonymized IP address, device & browser data;
- **Anonymized information about your use of our website**: including how you end up on our website, what actions you perform and the pages you visited.
- **Registration information:**
  When you register for an account, we collect your name, username, hashed password and email address.
- **Billing information:**
  If you pay for Formbricks, we will ask for your billing details including name, address and financial information depending on your payment method (stored by our payment service provider Stripe)
- **Survey data:**
  We store your survey data (questions and responses) for you and provide tools for you to analyse and use this data.
- **Error logs:**
  We collect error logs to help us diagnose and fix issues with our service.

## **How we use your data**

Formbricks does not sell personal data to third parties. Generally, we only collect your data with your consent in order to:

- Provide and improve our Service.
- Email you essential updates and offers (only if you're interested).
- Ensure our product works smoothly and fix any issues.
- Respond to legal situations and prevent fraud.

## **Retention of Data**

We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

## **Data Subprocessors**

We only share your information with our Service providers who help us operate our business, in which case those third parties are also required to comply with the GDPR framework. We worked hard to reduce the number of subprocessors to a minimum and keep your information within the EU. This is a list of the subprocessors we are working with:

## **Data retention**

If you are a Formbricks Researcher we do not delete the data in your account. You can delete data in your Formbricks account. You are responsible for the time period for which you store the data.

If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Researcher how long your responses will be stored in Formbricks.

All form data which has been deleted by the form Researcher is permanently deleted from our back-ups within 90 days.

## **Researcher's data protection rights**

Formbricks Researchers can exercise their rights directly with us.

If you’ve submitted your personal data through a Formbricks form, the Researcher who created the form is responsible for the collected data. Formbricks only processes the data. Respondents should contact the person or organization which created the form. If this isn't possible, please contact us. We'll help in any way we can.

## **Researcher's Rights Under GDPR**

If you are a resident of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights, covered by GDPR. – See more at [GDPR Official Site](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).

## **Researcher's Data Protection Rights under CalOPPA**

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at [CalOPPA Official Site](https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/).
